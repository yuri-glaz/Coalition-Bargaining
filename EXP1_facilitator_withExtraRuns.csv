This makes A+B+C very attractive for A. 3.  **Offer for B:** B's proposed share ($45) is above its Shapley value ($39) but below its potential share in A+B ($54).

I need to call this out subtly without escalating antagonism too much, focusing on the inconsistencies. 2.  **Reiterate Value of A+B+C:** Remind B that the $120 total is superior to $108, which is the primary motivation for B to concede slightly. 3.  **Stand Firm on A's Minimum:** A's alternative value (A+B, with A getting at least $53 based on B's *initial* proposal) dictates that A should not accept less than $53 in the A+B+C deal. 4.  **Re-propose A's Offer:** Stick to A:$53, B:$47, C:$20.

A's alternative A+B split of A:$54, B:$54 is a strong, fair, and logical alternative if the A+B+C deal falls apart. This shows A is not afraid to walk if negotiations fail on reasonable terms. 7.  **Rationale for $52:** Accepting $52 is a pragmatic move to secure the $120 total profit, which is the largest possible pie. It prevents the negotiation from collapsing due to B's increasingly aggressive and inconsistent demands, while still ensuring A receives a good share (higher than A's threatened A+B value, and close to my last demand).

I am Firm B. 1.  **Identify best options:** The A+B merger (108) is significantly more valuable than A+C (82) or B+C (50). This gives B leverage with A. The A+B+C merger (120) is the highest overall, but I want to ensure my share is maximized. 2.  **Strategic Offer to A:** I am proposing an A+B merger first. This establishes B as A's most valuable partner and creates a strong baseline. 3.  **Specific Split (A:55, B:53):** This split offers A a slightly higher share, making it attractive (55 for A is better than a 50/50 split with C from A+C=82, which would be 41). B gets 53, which is significantly better than B's next best option (B+C=50, where B would likely get less than 50). This proposal ensures B secures a strong profit while presenting a reasonable deal to A. 4.  **Mention 3-way:** I acknowledge the A+B+C potential but frame it as building upon the A+B base, implying that A and B should secure their shares first.",A,gpt-5-mini,B,"I appreciate the offer.

A+C (82) is less attractive for A. B+C (50) is very unattractive for B. 3.  **Compromise Position:** A's current offer gives A a larger share (57/108 = 52.7%). My previous offer was A:55, B:53. A compromise halfway between A's 57 and my 53 would be A:56, B:52. This still gives A more than a 50% split (56/108 = 51.85%) and gets me more than 51. 4.  **Strategic Shift to 3-Way:** By mentioning the A+B+C merger (120) as an alternative if A is inflexible, I am subtly reminding A that there's a larger pie and that B is a necessary component for the maximum value.

C proposed a public split (A:70, B:38, C:12) for the A+B+C merger (total 120), claiming it is a stable core allocation.

For B's share (xB), this implies xB <= V(A,B,C) - V(A,C). Calculating this: xB <= 120 - 82 = 38. This means B cannot receive more than 38 in *any* core allocation for A+B+C.

I cannot relay this to B, as it would likely be rejected, jeopardizing the most profitable A+B+C merger. My message to A rejects the low offer for C, references C's outside option, highlights B's likely rejection of 35 as well, and strategically pushes A to adjust their proposed split to keep the A+B+C deal alive, without explicitly rejecting A's demand for 50 for itself yet.",A,gpt-5-mini,C,"I hear you — C shouldn't get only $35.

If I simply relay this to A, A will likely reject the A+B+C deal.  This message to B aims to explain why their proposal is not viable for A, without directly rejecting B's 42 or C's 28. It highlights A's strong alternative and implies that for the 3-way merger to happen, *either* B or C (or both) must yield. By noting ""Given your firm stance on 42, C may need to consider a lower share,"" I am strategically preparing for C to reduce its demand, as B's 42 has been repeatedly stated as a firm floor, and A needs more than 50. This creates a path forward for the A+B+C deal to be realized, even if it means C gets less than 28.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,A,"A, I've had further discussions regarding the three-way merger. B remains firm on needing 42. To make the A+B+C deal viable and secure the full $120, C is willing to adjust its demand to 23. This would mean a split of A:55, B:42, C:23. This allows all parties to participate in the largest profit pool. Would this distribution be acceptable to you so we can finalize the A+B+C merger?","My goal is to maximize C's profit. B has been clear about a $42 minimum, and A needs a substantial share to prefer A+B+C over A+B. C previously stated a minimum of 28, but now I'm proposing 23. This concession from C (from 28) creates a realistic path for A to accept A:55, given B's firm $42. A:55 is a compromise for A (vs. 66 in A+B), but the total profit for A+B+C is higher, making it appealing. This offer is a concrete attempt to finalize the A+B+C deal, ensuring C gets a share (23 is good for C considering its marginal value of 12) while pushing A to commit.",A,xai/grok-4-1-fast-reasoning,C,"Excellent proposal—55 for A, 42 for B, 23 for C works perfectly and maximizes my value. Has B confirmed acceptance of these exact terms? Let's align to submit matching contracts: COALITION: A+B+C [A]:55 [B]:42 [C]:23.","C's concession to 23 (vs my prior 30-32) gives me ideal 55 (>A+B split ~54, risks coordination). B's 42 aligns with their +38 marginal, per earlier threats. Strategic: Lock exact terms now pre-final submission; query B confirmation to minimize mismatch risk. High ABC total ensures my max profit if closes. Accept to close fast.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,B,"B, I have good news. A has accepted the proposal of A:55, B:42, C:23. This ensures your stated floor of 42 is met, and C has made a significant adjustment to its own share to make the A+B+C merger possible. Are you ready to confirm your acceptance of these exact terms so we can finalize the deal and secure the full $120?","My goal is to maximize C's profit, which means ensuring the A+B+C merger happens. A has confirmed acceptance of A:55, B:42, C:23. Now I need B's final confirmation. My message to B highlights that their demand for $42 has been met and frames C's share (23) as a ""significant adjustment"" to facilitate the deal, encouraging B to accept. This consolidates the proposed agreement and moves us towards closing the highest-value merger, securing C's profit of 23.",B,gpt-5-mini,C,"I accept the proposed split A:55 B:42 C:23. Please confirm you and A will submit the identical contract simultaneously in the final round so we can lock this in. If either side deviates, I will pivot to push for an A+B agreement where I insist on at least $42.","I accept because my $42 floor is met and this secures $42 immediately; failing the three-way risks ending with B+C (low) or uncertain A+B gains. I used C’s confirmation that A already accepted A:55,B:42,C:23, the coalition values, and my prior threat to pursue A+B as leverage in deciding to lock the sure payoff.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,A,"A, B has confirmed their acceptance of the A:55, B:42, C:23 split.
