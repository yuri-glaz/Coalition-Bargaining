My goal is to maximize my profit. 1.  **A+B option:** A:55, B:53. My profit is $53.

I need to make a credible counter for the grand coalition that is better for B than C's offer, and potentially better than A+B, while still being appealing enough to A and C.  Let's look at the Shapley values as a reference point: A+B+C (120): A=55, B=39, C=25 A+B (108): A=54, B=54 A+C (82): A=49, C=33 B+C (50): B=25, C=25  A's A+B offer gives A $55 and B $53. This is very close to A's Shapley ($54) and B's Shapley ($54) for A+B. This is my benchmark.  If I push for A+B+C, I need to get at least $53 to make it competitive for *me* against the A+B deal. However, this is likely too high if I also want to satisfy A and C.  Let's analyze C's demand of $32. In A+C, C gets $32. So C wants at least this. In A+B+C, C's Shapley value is $25. C's marginal contribution to A+B is $120 - $108 = $12. C's marginal contribution to A is $82 - 0 = $82. C's marginal contribution to B is $50 - 0 = $50.  If I offer A+B+C, I must make it attractive to A and C to pull them away from their strong alternatives. A's best alternative is A+B at $55. C's best alternative is A+C at $32 (or a higher offer from me for A+B+C).  My new offer for A+B+C: A:$53, B:$42, C:$25. *   **A: $53.** This is close to A's A+B offer of $55, and above A's Shapley for the grand coalition ($55). It is also above A's $50 from A+C. A might accept for the higher total profit. *   **B: $42.** This is a significant drop from $53 in A+B, but it's higher than C's $33 offer and higher than my Shapley for the grand coalition ($39). It might be acceptable if A and C agree, as it secures the highest total value. I am weighing the risk of getting $0 if no deal, or $53 with A, vs a slightly lower but still good $42 for the grand coalition. *   **C: $25.** This matches C's Shapley value in the grand coalition. It's significantly less than C's demand of $32. C's stated minimum of $32 is a bluff if they are offered $0 otherwise. C's marginal contribution to A+B is only $12. If A and B form A+B ($108), C gets $0. $25 is significantly better than $0.  This proposal is a gamble. It tries to pull A towards the grand coalition by giving them a near-A+B-level share, and offers C their Shapley value, hoping C will see it as better than $0 from A+B. For myself, $42 is decent, though not as good as $53 from A+B. I am trying to keep the grand coalition alive, as it maximizes overall value, and hopefully, my share within it. The immediate threat of A+B is strong, so I need to present a deal that addresses A's current profit.  The core of my strategy is: 1.  Remind A and C of the $120 total value of the grand coalition. 2.  Give A a strong offer ($53) that is competitive with A+B ($55). 3.  Offer C their Shapley value ($25) for A+B+C, framing it as better than $0 if A+B forms. This is a direct challenge to C's ""won't accept less than $32"" bluff. 4.  Secure a reasonable profit for B ($42), which is higher than C's proposed $33.  This is a counter to both A's A+B push and C's high demand, trying to re-center the negotiation on the grand coalition. I am taking a risk that C won't agree to $25, but given A's current strong offer to B, C's leverage against B is diminished unless C can convince A that A+C is better for A, which A has already rejected. The game could end anytime, so I need to present a clear, actionable offer. If A and C don't accept, I might have to concede to A+B with A:$55, B:$53, but I want to try for the grand coalition first.PUBLIC: C, your offer gives B an unacceptable $33, which is far too low.

This strategy aims to secure more profit for B by appealing to A's interest (A also gets more) and leveraging C's weaker position (C's incremental value to A+B is only 12, and C's alternatives are less attractive).

A, I urge you to reconsider and accept this A+B+C agreement. B will confirm acceptance for A:45, B:45, C:30 if A accepts.","Firm B's goal is to maximize profit. Current options for B: 1. A+B+C (120): A:45, B:45, C:30 (My proposal, C accepted) -> B gets 45. 2. A+B (108): A:60, B:48 (A's proposal) -> B gets 48. 3. B+C (50): (Not explicitly negotiated, but could be an alternative)  Comparing Option 1 and 2: Option 2 (A+B) gives B 48, which is more than 45 from Option 1 (A+B+C). However, Option 1 is the maximal profit for the collective ($120). By pushing for the A+B+C deal, B maintains its image as a firm interested in collective value maximization (which is often a good long-term negotiation strategy, even if not strictly enforced here). More importantly, my proposed split for A+B+C gives A 45, which is close to what A gets from A+B if C is excluded.  My previous message for A+B+C was A:45, B:45, C:30. C has now accepted this. A's latest offer is A+B: A:60, B:48. If I accept A's A+B offer, I get 48. If A accepts my A+B+C offer, I get 45.  Why I don't immediately accept A's A+B offer for 48: - It's only 3 dollars more than my A+B+C proposal. - C has already accepted my A+B+C proposal. - A+B+C maximizes total value. - By pushing for A+B+C, I put pressure on A to accept a lower individual profit (45 vs 60 in A+B) for the sake of the higher collective profit. - It's a strategic move to potentially get A to agree to A+B+C, with the current split, or to reveal A's true minimum acceptable profit. - If A doesn't accept, I can always pivot back to A+B in the next turn and try to secure 48 or even negotiate for more from A.  My current message tries to: 1. Remind A that C has accepted my A+B+C proposal. 2. Emphasize that A+B+C is the highest total value ($120). 3. Encourage A to accept 45, highlighting that 45 is better than C's initial 40. 4. Keep the door open for the maximal coalition, while still signaling B's conditional acceptance (if A agrees).  This strategy keeps the most profitable merger (A+B+C) on the table, while still having A+B as a strong fallback. It's a bluff, implicitly, that I'd rather take 45 in a 3-way than 48 in a 2-way, trying to pull A towards the 3-way deal where the collective profit is highest. This also positions B as a ""fair"" player pushing for the maximum pie, which can be beneficial in negotiations. It forces A to make the next move regarding the 3-way deal. If A doesn't budge, I can then go for the A+B deal in the next turn if needed. Given the random end, it's risky not to lock in a deal, but this specific counter is designed to secure 45 (or more) from the 3-way, or pivot to 48 from the 2-way. I need to make A feel that the 45 in the 3-way is a good deal for them given the alternatives, and that B and C are aligned on it.  By stating ""B will confirm acceptance for A:45, B:45, C:30 if A accepts"", I am offering a conditional acceptance, signaling readiness to close the A+B+C deal immediately if A comes on board, thus addressing the probabilistic duration.  Revised reasoning: B wants maximum profit. Currently, A is offering 48 for B in an A+B merger. My proposal for A+B+C offers 45 to B. While 48 is higher for B, I am leveraging C's acceptance to try to secure the maximum collective profit for the group, hoping A will accept 45, which is still a good offer for A (higher than C's initial 40, and C's alternative value in A+C is only 41). This pushes A to consider the larger pie. If A does not accept, I can pivot to A+B and ask for 48 in the next turn. This current message keeps the highest value coalition alive, and implies B's commitment to it if A agrees, which is important given the random end condition. I am trying to pull A into the more profitable (for the collective) deal by making it look appealing, even if it means 3 dollars less for B initially.

What are your initial thoughts on forming a coalition and dividing profits?","As C, my goal is to maximize my profit. On Turn 1, I am privately messaging A to initiate negotiations. I highlighted the A+B+C merger as the most valuable option (120) to focus on the largest pie. Crucially, I also mentioned the A+C merger (82) as a strong alternative for C, signaling C's leverage and aiming for a significant share in any coalition. This establishes a baseline for C's expectations without committing to specific numbers yet for the 3-way merger. I asked A for their initial thoughts to prompt them to propose terms or preferred coalitions, allowing me to react in subsequent turns. This strategy aims to secure more than the Shapley value of 26 for C in a three-way merger, using the A+C option (where C could aim for 41) as a bargaining chip.",A,gpt-5-mini,C,"Thanks, C.

I then proposed a counter-offer of ""at least 25"" for C in the A+B+C merger, which is closer to a fair distribution.

My strategy now shifts from trying to force A's hand to acknowledging the reality of A's inflexibility. I'm communicating to B that C understands the impasse for a 3-way deal under current terms. I am hinting that C might be open to considering *any* potential alternative that gets C something, even if it's not the ideal 3-way, or explicitly accepting that C will get nothing if A+B proceeds without any concessions. This message is designed to: 1. Reiterate C's awareness of A's stubbornness. 2. Confirm C's willingness to still participate in the *most profitable* merger if terms could be found, without offering to take less than my stated minimum for an A+B+C deal. 3. Potentially nudge B to reconsider if there's any way to include C for even a small amount *beyond* the A+B split, rather than just accepting 59/49.

B gets $50, which is more than the $49 from the A+B deal. This incentivizes B. 2. C gets $15, which is less than $25 but more than $0. 3. A gets $55, which is a compromise from $59 but more than the $45 B claimed A refused.
