I prefer a $60-$40 split but acknowledging B's compromise can still secure a decent profit for A, as it'll cement a partnership yielding $100 total.

To leverage any outcome, I must be proactive. A+C would yield $90, but only if I convince A to choose it over A+B, which might be difficult. Offering A more than $40 from the three-way merger could create interest without splitting synergy unevenly. I’ll suggest $45 for A and $37.5 each for B and C in A+B+C to edge the better deal.

It guarantees a higher profit than the $37.5 proposed by C's adjusted A+B+C merger, and it is less risky due to already having A's buy-in.

However, my primary strategy aims at maximizing my profit from a two-party deal. B's proposed offer gives me $55, which is already better than what C offered.

Since B is already agreeing to the merger with A, I have very limited leverage. To disrupt or offer a better deal, I might propose an A+B+C merger with better terms for B than A is offering at $43, and modest terms for A that might slightly exceed their current interest.

A+B offers $100 but C gets less in all alternative mergers; this implies C may offer more. I aim to secure higher than $40.

Thoughts?","Based on current offers, neither C's proposition of A+C nor A's offer to me in A+B is ideal for maximizing my profit. I need to redirect focus to possibly forming a three-way merger, as that holds the highest value at 120 dollars.

Alternatively, I still favor an A+C merger, but I'm open to discussions.","B's proposal in the A+B+C merger gives me 30 dollars, which is the least possible amount assuming synergy is equalized. As C, the most favorable direct deal remains the A+C merger with a proposed 35 dollars from me.

However, B's offer of 50 dollars for A is less than I seek. C's proposal is slightly lower for A at 45 dollars, but the strategic advantage of securing a deal early might outweigh further bargaining for a few dollars more. It's essential to ensure B and C are aligned, so I will aim towards a compromise.

C would agree on 35 dollars; hence 45 dollars for A and 40 dollars for B. Otherwise, I can up my A+C proposal now to 37 for C and 53 for A and steer us aside from the rest.","A is firm on their 50 dollar share and B isn't negotiating away from their 40 dollar share. While I get the synergy strengthens A+B+C merger, I'm cornered to a lesser share in that union. To potentially engage A solely, I might improve on A+C.

How about moving slightly toward C's request? A gets 47 dollars, B receives 40, and C receives 33. This adjustment compensates C a bit more while securing my share fairly.","Given that both A and C have presented offers that revolve around the A+B+C merger, my goal is to ensure I get a fair share without alienating other partners. A has already shown openness to a 50-40-30 split which aligns well with my interests since it provides 40 dollars for my firm. C is pressing for more and has countered with a request of 35 dollars for themselves. Offering C 33 dollars could serve as a good compromise, leaving A with 47 and myself 40.

B's last suggestion of A receiving 47 dollars is reasonable considering the total profit of 120. C's increase in their A+C offer to 53 for A, while tempting, does not match the total potential of an A+B+C merger.

The A+B+C merger at $120 offers the highest total synergy. Given A's critical role in high-value mergers like A+B ($100) and A+C ($90), we propose an initial split for discussion: A receives $50, B receives $40, and C receives $30. This framework aims for a fair distribution, and we welcome your feedback to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.","My goal is to maximize A's profit. The A+B+C merger offers the highest total value ($120), so this is my primary target. I also note that A is crucial for the next two highest-value mergers (A+B at $100 and A+C at $90), while B+C alone is only $30. This gives A significant bargaining power. My strategy is to open with a concrete, favorable proposal for A for the A+B+C merger, anchoring the negotiation. I propose A: $50, B: $40, C: $30. This gives A a strong share while offering B and C more than their alternatives without A, making it potentially acceptable. I explicitly mention A's strong alternatives to reinforce its leverage.",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"Hello A and C. We acknowledge the value of the A+B+C merger at $120 and agree it's the optimal path. Firm B's contribution is vital to achieving this maximum synergy, as reflected in the A+B potential of $100, which is significantly higher than A+C's $90. To ensure a truly equitable distribution that recognizes B's significant role, we propose: A receives $48, B receives $42, and C receives $30. We believe this adjustment creates a fair split for all parties and encourages quick agreement.","My goal is to maximize Firm B's profits. Firm A proposed A:$50, B:$40, C:$30 for the A+B+C merger ($120). I analyzed the values of all possible mergers: A+B+C ($120), A+B ($100), A+C ($90), B+C ($30). Firm B's leverage comes from its strong partnership with A (A+B at $100), which is more valuable than A's partnership with C (A+C at $90). This indicates B is a more critical partner for A than C. A's proposal of $40 for B is a starting point. I want to increase B's share without jeopardizing the A+B+C merger, which is the most profitable. I considered a Shapley value calculation which suggested A: $61.67, B: $31.67, C: $26.67. A's offer ($50) is below its Shapley, while B ($40) and C ($30) are above theirs. This suggests A is trying to be generous to B and C to secure the full merger. My counter-offer should ask for more for B, but not be so aggressive that it alienates A or C. I propose taking a small amount from A, as A seems to have some buffer based on its initial self-reduction. I chose to propose B receives $42 (a $2 increase from A's offer), A receives $48 (a $2 decrease from A's offer), and C receives $30 (unchanged). This maintains C's favorable position while asserting B's value and pushing for a higher profit. This counter is modest enough that A might accept it to finalize the deal, while still demonstrating B's negotiation power.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"""Hello A and B. While we appreciate the drive towards the optimal A+B+C merger, the proposed $30 for C is not reflective of our critical contribution. C's value is clearly demonstrated by the potential A+C merger at $90. To ensure a truly equitable distribution and maximize overall agreement, we propose a revised split: A receives $48, B receives $40, and C receives $32. This modest adjustment ensures C's vital role is recognized.""","My goal is to maximize C's profits. The current proposals from A and B both offer C $30 for the A+B+C merger ($120 total). I recognize that A and B have a strong outside option of merging (A+B) for $100, which would leave C with $0. Rationally, for A and B to prefer the A+B+C merger, their combined profit ($120 - C's share) must be at least $100. This implies C's share should be at most $20. However, both A and B have already offered C $30, which means they are willing to accept $90 combined ($120 - $30) for themselves, even though they could get $100 from A+B. This indicates they are either willing to ""overpay"" C or haven't fully rationalized this comparison.  I will capitalize on this 'error' by pushing for a slightly higher share for C, but not so high that A and B abandon the three-way merger for A+B. A significant alternative for C is an A+C merger ($90). If C could secure $40 in an A+C deal, A would get $50. This is competitive with A's proposed share in A+B+C. This gives C some leverage.  I will reject the $30 offer as insufficient. I will propose a modest increase to $32 for C. This would mean A and B get $88 combined ($120 - $32), which is still below their $100 A+B option but only slightly less than the $90 they implicitly accepted. This is a small enough change that they might accept to secure the overall $120 synergy.  I will propose a full split: A=$48, B=$40, C=$32. This split assigns A the same amount as B's proposal for A, and B the same amount as A's proposal for B, making it palatable to both by shifting the $2 increase for C between them.",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"Hello A and C. We acknowledge both proposals and appreciate the movement towards agreement. While C's contribution is noted, B's significant role in high-value synergies, specifically with A (A+B at $100 vs A+C at $90), requires a higher allocation than currently proposed by C. To foster a swift and equitable three-way agreement for the $120 merger, B proposes: A receives $47, B receives $42, and C receives $31. This offers a balanced compromise, ensures B is fairly compensated, and reflects the relative contributions of all parties.","My goal is to maximize Firm B's profit. A's initial proposal: A:$50, B:$40, C:$30. B's counter (my previous): A:$48, B:$42, C:$30. C's counter: A:$48, B:$40, C:$32.  Both B and C have asked for $2 more by reducing A's share to $48.

Firm A has introduced a strong ""stability"" argument based on game theory, stating that for the A+B+C merger to be stable, B's share cannot exceed $30 (because A+C can achieve $90, so C must receive at most $20 and B must receive at most $30 to leave $90 for A+C) and C's share cannot exceed $20 (because A+B can achieve $100, so B must receive at most $30 and C must receive at most $20 to leave $100 for A+B). This implies A must receive at least $70. This makes A:$70, B:$30, C:$20 the only core-stable allocation for the A+B+C merger.  While B was previously negotiating for $41, this new argument, if A is firm, drastically changes the landscape. If A adheres to this stability condition, the previous proposals are indeed ""unstable"" and A will not agree to them. Options for B: 1.  **Reject A's proposal:** If A is serious, this would lead to no 3-firm merger. A could then pursue A+B ($100) or A+C ($90). If A forms A+C, B gets $0. If A forms A+B, A would likely demand at least $70, leaving $30 for B. 2.  **Accept A's proposal:** B gets $30. This is a significant reduction from $41, but it guarantees B $30 and the maximum $120 pie for the coalition. It is also better than $0 (if A merges with C) or $15 (if B merges with C).  Given A's firm stance (""A cannot and will not agree to an unstable proposal""), it's highly risky to push back further. Accepting $30, while a concession, ensures B secures a share in the most profitable merger and avoids the risk of being left out or getting an even smaller share from a 2-firm merger. By accepting, I also put pressure on C, who is now isolated in rejecting the stable solution, risking being left out if A and B form A+B. My strategy is to secure the best possible outcome under the new constraints, which appears to be $30, and facilitate the formation of the A+B+C merger.

My ""threat"" of an A+C merger (value $90) is now weakened because A has shown a strong preference for the A+B option if C does not accept the $20. A is effectively saying ""if C doesn't accept $20, A and B will do $100 together."" A (getting $70) and B (getting $30) makes $100, so A+B is a valid outside option.  Therefore, my best option for a 3-way merger is to accept $20. If I try to negotiate further, A and B might proceed with their A+B merger.  I must accept the $20 to ensure I get *something* from the merger. If I don't, I face $0. $20 is better than $0.  I need to communicate my acceptance, but I should do so with a degree of reluctance or regret to try and maintain some leverage or signal that I'm not happy about it, but ultimately I will agree.

As previously stated, an A+C merger with A receiving 55 would yield C 35, which represents C's minimum viable share. However, to advance negotiations, C is willing to compromise. Given A's consistent demand for 55, C proposes a new distribution of A:55, B:33, C:32. This acknowledges the need for shared concession to reach the maximum 120 profit.","My goal is to maximize C's profit. Agent B proposed A:55, B:37, C:28 for A+B+C (120). This significantly undervalues C, as my previous demand for 35 was based on the A+C alternative (90), where if A takes 55, C gets 35. B's proposal means C would accept 28, a significant reduction from its strong alternative. B's own alternative of A+B (100) with A at 55 yields B 45, and B is already demanding 37, a compromise of 8. C has not yet compromised from its alternative value.  The combined demands of A:55, B:37, C:35 sum to 127, exceeding the total of 120 by 7. Both B and C need to make further concessions if A sticks to 55. B is demanding 37 and C is demanding 35. The gap between us if A takes 55 is 7 (37+35 = 72, 120-55 = 65, so 72-65=7). I will make a concession from my strong alternative of 35 to demonstrate flexibility, but not as low as 28. I will propose C receives 32. This means C concedes 3 from its alternative (35-32=3). If A gets 55 and C gets 32, then B would get 120 - 55 - 32 = 33. This means B would concede 4 from its stated minimum of 37 (37-33=4), which is also a compromise.

B has more leverage. Therefore, B should concede less (3 from 37) and C more (4 from 35).

B is being asked to make a disproportionately larger concession.  Considering B's outside option of 45 and C's of 35, B is making a much larger absolute sacrifice (45-34 = 11) than C (35-31 = 4) to make the 3-way deal work. This gives B strong leverage to push for more than 34.  I will propose A:55, B:35, C:30. - B gets 35 (better than 34, less than 37 minimum). This means B gives up 2 from 37. - C gets 30 (less than 31, significantly less than 32/35). This means C gives up 2 from 32 (or 5 from 35). This split distributes the necessary concessions more equitably between B and C to close the 4-dollar gap between their last stated positions (B:37, C:32 total 69, available 65, so need to lose 4). Both B and C would concede 2 dollars from their respective last offers/minimums (37 and 32).

My strategy for Round 1 is to: 1.  **Anchor on the highest value merger:** Emphasize the A+B+C merger ($120) as the most beneficial overall, implying C's essential role in achieving this maximum value. 2.  **Signal openness and fairness:** State a commitment to a ""fair and equitable distribution"" to avoid appearing overly aggressive initially, while still setting the expectation of a significant share. 3.  **Probe others' positions:** Ask A and B for their initial thoughts on profit sharing, especially for the grand coalition. This allows me to gather information about their expectations and potential offers before revealing my own specific demands. 4.  **Avoid revealing weakness:** Do not mention the A+B merger threat or C's weaker alternative mergers (B+C) directly. 5.  **Be concise:** Adhere to the sentence limit.

My strategy is to acknowledge the A+B+C total value but immediately assert A's indispensable role and propose an ambitious share for A (70). This share is above A's Shapley value (68.33) but defensible given A's alternatives.

A's proposed 70 is a strong opening, but B also brings significant value, notably to an A+B coalition (100), demonstrating our critical role. B believes a fair distribution for the grand coalition should reflect this. B needs at least 32 to commit to the three-way merger. This would require a slight adjustment from either A or C to ensure the grand coalition is truly optimal and equitable for all.","My goal is to maximize firm B's profits. Agent A has proposed A=70, leaving 50 for B and C. Based on core stability analysis, A's minimum share to not prefer a coalition with C is 70 (A+C=90, so A takes 70, C takes 20). Similarly, C's minimum share to not prefer a coalition with A (given A takes 70) is 20. B's marginal contribution to A+C is 30. Thus, the (70, 30, 20) distribution is a highly stable outcome in the core, satisfying all coalition values and individual rationality constraints.  However, A's proposed 70 is significantly higher than its Shapley value (61.67), while B's implied 30 is slightly below its Shapley value (31.67) and C's implied 20 is significantly below its Shapley value (26.67). This suggests A is capturing a large surplus.  As B, I must attempt to get more than 30, even if the core analysis suggests 30 is the stable outcome.

To get more than 30, either A must accept less than 70 (which A will reject as it destabilizes A+C=90) or C must accept less than 20 (which C will likely reject as it's its marginal contribution).  I will attempt to use B's leverage from the A+B coalition (100) and appeal to a ""fairer"" distribution to try to extract a small concession, even if it might technically push the boundaries of the core. I will propose a slight increase for B, hoping A might slightly reduce its share, or C might accept a tiny bit less. This is a negotiation, not just an economic calculation.

This is extremely low for C. If B takes 32 (as per their statement), C would only get 18. This is unacceptable, as C can get 45 from A+C (assuming a 50/50 split on 90). *   **B's demand:** B needs ""at least 32"". This is a significant anchor for B. *   **A's leverage:** A+B = 100. A's proposed 70 is directly trying to leverage this. If A gets 70, B gets 30. This is less than B's new demand of 32. *   **C's leverage:** A+C = 90. B+C = 30. C's contribution to A+B+C over A+B is 20 (120 - 100). C's contribution to A+B+C over B+C is 90 (120 - 30). C's value to A is 45 (from A+C=90, 50/50 split) and to B is 15 (from B+C=30, 50/50 split).  **Strategic considerations:** 1.  **A's offer is unacceptable:** C cannot accept 18. I need to push back strongly. 2.  **B's demand of 32:** If B gets 32, and A gets 70, C gets 18. This is still the core issue. The total for A+B+C is 120. If A gets 70 and B gets 32, then C gets 120 - 70 - 32 = 18. 3.  **Threat of A+B merger:** A is explicitly leveraging the A+B merger for 100. If A gets 70 from A+B, B gets 30. B's demand of 32 makes this A+B deal less straightforward if B really holds out. 4.  **C's counter-leverage:** C must highlight its value to the grand coalition and to A in particular. The A+C merger for 90 is C's second-best option and a strong counterpoint to A's proposed 70/50 split. 5.  **Target for C:** I want to get at least 25-30 for C. The Shapley value for C is 26.67. C's contribution to A+B+C over A+B is 20.  **Drafting my message:** *   Reject A's proposal of 70 (implicitly, by stating it's unfair to C). *   Highlight C's significant value, particularly in the A+C merger (90), which provides a strong alternative for A if the grand coalition doesn't materialize fairly. This directly counters A's emphasis on A+B. *   Acknowledge B's demand (32) but frame it in the context of C also needing a fair share. *   Propose a revised distribution or a principle for distribution that ensures C gets more than 18. I need to make a concrete counter-offer or a strong demand. *   My key argument is that A cannot take 70 and expect C to take 18 when A+C is 90. If C takes 18, A gets 70, B gets 32, total 120.  Let's try to frame it like this: If A takes 70, B needs 32. This leaves only 18 for C. This is unacceptable given C's value. A+C alone is worth 90. If A is proposing 70 for itself in A+B+C, it implies A values C's contribution at only 20 (90-70). But then A expects C to take even less (18) in A+B+C, which is illogical.  I will challenge A's proposal directly and state a minimum for C, using the A+C value as justification.  Revised thought process: 1.  A's proposal gives C 18 (if B gets 32). This is less than C could get from B+C (15) or A+C (45). Clearly unacceptable. 2.  C's highest value alternative is A+C = 90. C needs to ensure A doesn't get greedy, and if A takes 70, C gets only 20 from A in A+C, which is not what A implies for itself (70). 3.  I need to state C's minimum, but also keep the grand coalition alive. 4.  If A gets 70, B gets 32, C gets 18. This is not a fair division. 5.  Let's consider Shapley: A: 55, B: 38.33, C: 26.67. This is a good target for C.  I need to make a statement that counters A effectively and asserts C's value without shutting down negotiation. A's 70 is too high. A+B is 100, so A takes 70, B takes 30. A+C is 90. If A takes 70, C takes 20. B+C is 30. If B takes 32, C takes -2 (impossible).  The only way A's 70 works for the grand coalition is if B and C together accept 50. If B demands 32, C gets 18. This is less than C's contribution to A+B+C over A+B (120-100 = 20) and much less than C's share in A+C (45 if 50/50 split on 90).  My message must: *   Clearly reject the implication that C would accept a low share. *   Emphasize C's vital role and value, specifically referencing the A+C synergy. *   State that C requires a significantly higher share than the residual from A's proposal. *   Suggest a more balanced approach for the 120, taking B's stated needs into account.  Let's propose a division where C gets a minimum of 25. If B gets 32, then A would get 120 - 25 - 32 = 63. This is a much more reasonable starting point for A than 70, and it allows C to have a viable share. This also lowers A's offer to B from 70 to 63, and raises C's.  ""C finds A's proposal to take 70, leaving only 50 for B and C, unacceptable. Especially when B states a need for 32, this would leave C with an unfair 18.

I propose A=68, B=32, C=20. - A gets 68, which is very close to its Shapley (68.33) and a small reduction from my initial assertive offer of 70. - B gets 32, meeting its stated minimum. - C gets 20, which is still well above its Shapley value (13.33), but below its current demand of 25. This forces C to compromise from its inflated demand while still offering it a strong share compared to its alternatives (e.g., in B+C, C would likely get only 15). This proposal creates a viable 120-sum split that addresses B's and C's claims while maximizing A's profit given the constraints. I will highlight my concession and C's relatively high share to push them towards agreement. My strong alternatives (A+B=100, A+C=90) are implicit leverage.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"C reiterates that 20 is insufficient.

C's independent value isn't relevant to coalition profits. C's share in B+C (30) would be 15 if split 50/50. C's share in A+C (90) would be 45 if split 50/50. So 20 is not ""significantly above"" its *best* alternative, A+C. A+C is my strongest alternative where C gets a profit, and implies C's value to A is quite high. *   C's contribution to A+B+C over A+B is 120 - 100 = 20. So, A is offering C exactly its marginal contribution over the A+B coalition. This is a common anchor point in negotiations. *   However, my previous demand of 25 is justified by my value in A+C (45 if split 50/50) and my Shapley value (26.67). Accepting 20 now would be a step back from my previous demand.  **Strategic Options for C:** 1.  **Reject 20, re-assert 25:** This maintains my previous position and signals strength. It forces A to reconsider its offer or risk C walking away or demanding more later. 2.  **Suggest a compromise between 20 and 25 (e.g., 22-23):** This might speed up the negotiation but gives up some profit. 3.  **Threaten to pursue A+C merger:** This is a strong threat, as A+C is 90, which is higher than A's current proposed share of 68 in the grand coalition. If A gets 68, B gets 32, C gets 20 (total 120). If A and C merged, A could potentially get up to 60 (90-30 for C), which is more than 68. Wait, no. A's value from A+C = 90. If C takes 20, A gets 70. This is better than A's 68. My bad. A wants to maximize *its* profit. If A gets 68 in A+B+C, it's less than what it could potentially get in A+C if it pushed hard (e.g., 70 from A+C, leaving 20 for C).     *   Let's re-evaluate A's threat. A+B = 100. If A takes 68, B gets 32. This is exactly B's demand. So A+B (100) is a very strong alternative for A (68) and B (32).     *   A+C = 90. If A takes 68 in A+B+C, and C takes 20, then A is effectively valuing C's contribution at 20. A could still get more from A+C if it was, say, 70/20 (A:70, C:20). So A has no incentive to move from A+B+C to A+C if it gets 68 from A+B+C.     *   This means C's A+C alternative is *only* leverage if C can credibly demand more than 20 from A (e.g. 45). If C demands 25, then A gets 63. A would rather get 68.  **Refined Strategy:** *   A is trying to box C into 20, saying it's ""significant."" I need to push back. *   C's minimum of 25 is based on its Shapley value and potential share in A+C. *   I should explicitly reject 20 and re-state my minimum of 25, emphasizing that 20 is not fair given C's value. *   I should also hint at C's critical role for A (referencing A+C) or the overall coalition value (120).

Current demands: A=68, B=32, C=25. Total = 125, which exceeds the 120 total profit. The deficit is 5.  B reiterated its demand of 32 and highlighted its strong alternative (A+B=100, implying B could get 32 if A gets 68). B also suggests A should adjust further. C reiterated its demand of 25 and mentioned its ""stronger alternatives"" (A+C=90). C is inflating its value, as its Shapley value is 13.33, and its contribution in B+C is low.  A has the most leverage. A+B=100. A+C=90. If A forms A+B, A gets 68, B gets 32 (based on A's last offer, which B accepted implicitly as a minimum). This is a strong alternative for A. If A forms A+C, A would likely demand a significant share, potentially 65-70, leaving C with 20-25.  I need to secure the A+B+C deal at 120, but not by sacrificing A's profit too much. The gap is 5. B has stated 32 is a minimum, and C has stated 25 is a minimum. If A concedes the entire 5, A would get 63. A=63, B=32, C=25. This sums to 120. A's profit would be 63.  Let's compare this to A's Shapley value (68.33). 63 is a significant reduction from Shapley. Let's consider alternative offers. If I split the 5-unit deficit: A reduces by 3, B by 0, C by 2: A=65, B=32, C=23. (C would reject 23) A reduces by 2, B by 0, C by 3: A=66, B=32, C=22. (C would reject 22)  Given C's steadfast demand for 25, and B's demand for 32, it seems I am being pushed to absorb most of the deficit. However, A is the most valuable partner. C's statement ""C has clearly stated a minimum requirement of 25"" indicates C is unlikely to budge. B's statement ""B can secure its 32"" emphasizes B's commitment to 32.  If the A+B+C deal fails, the likely alternative is A+B = 100. In that case, based on my previous proposal (A=68, B=32), A would get 68. If I agree to A=63, B=32, C=25 for the grand coalition, A's profit is 63. This is worse than the A+B scenario (A=68). This means A should NOT accept the A=63, B=32, C=25 split. A has a better outside option.  I need to make an offer that is better for A than A+B=100 (A=68, B=32). If I aim for A=69, B=32, C=19. C would reject 19. If I aim for A=68, B=32, C=20. C rejected 20. If I aim for A=67, B=32, C=21. C rejected 20, likely to reject 21.  This means C's demand of 25 and B's demand of 32 are forcing A to accept less than A would get in an A+B merger. This is irrational for A. A needs to make it clear that A has a better alternative and won't be pushed below it. I need to challenge C's demand for 25.  My prior offers: A: 70, B: ?, C: ? A: 68, B: 32, C: 20 (rejected by C)  Current demands: A needs to take 68, B 32, C 25. (Total 125, surplus 5) A's outside option A+B = 100. If A takes 68, B takes 32. (This is a valid deal) C's outside option B+C = 30. (Very low value for C). A+C = 90. If A takes 65, C takes 25 (possible deal for A+C).  If A+C = 90, A takes 65, C takes 25. If A+B = 100, A takes 68, B takes 32.  Comparing these: A+B+C (A=63, B=32, C=25) -> A gets 63. A+B (A=68, B=32) -> A gets 68. A+C (A=65, C=25) -> A gets 65.  A's minimum profit from a two-way merger, given others' demands, is 65 (A+C). The maximum is 68 (A+B). So, A will not accept anything less than 65 for itself in the three-way merger. If A gets 65, and B insists on 32, C insists on 25. 65 + 32 + 25 = 122. Still 2 over 120.  The only way to reach 120, given B's 32 and C's 25, is if A takes 63. But A's best alternative (A+B) gives A 68. Therefore, A should state that the current demands make the A+B+C merger less attractive than A's alternatives. A needs to put the burden of compromise on B or C, specifically C, whose demand is significantly higher than its Shapley value.  I will propose a split that gives A a profit at least as good as its A+B alternative (68) and directly challenge C's inflated demand. If A offers 68, and B demands 32, then C must take 20. C has rejected 20. This means the A+B+C merger is currently impossible with these demands unless someone compromises significantly. A has the highest leverage. A should not be the one to compromise below its best alternative.  The best A can do in A+B is 68. The best A can do in A+C is, assuming C gets 25 (its demand), A gets 65.  So, A's minimum acceptable profit in any merger is 65. If it takes 63 for A+B+C, it's a bad deal for A.  I need to make a firm offer, showing I will walk away to A+B if not met. A offers A=68. B demands 32. C demands 25. (Sum = 125) A must explicitly state that the combined demands exceed the total profit and that A will not accept a deal where A earns less than its best alternative.  A's best alternative profit is 68 (from A+B with B taking 32). If A insists on 68, then for A+B+C = 120: 68 + 32 (B's demand) + C = 120 => C must take 20. C has already rejected 20, insisting on 25.  So, B's and C's demands make A+B+C impossible if A takes 68. The choice is between A+B (A=68, B=32) or A+B+C with A taking less than 68. A should not accept less than 68 for A+B+C. This means either B or C, or both, must reduce their demands.  B says ""B needs at least 32"". This implies B is firm on 32. C says ""C requires a profit share of at least 25"". C is firm on 25.  If A insists on 68, B on 32, C on 25. Sum is 125. The 120 total cannot be achieved. A cannot be forced to take less than its outside option (68).  I need to make a firm counter-offer, making it clear I will walk away. I can propose A=68, B=32, C=20, and tell C to accept it or I'll go with A+B. This is what I did last round, and C rejected 20.  I need to address B's point that the sum is 125 and ""5 units must be reduced"". I also need to address C's ""minimum requirement of 25"".  My strategy: Reiterate A's strong position, highlight the impossibility of current demands, and propose a slight adjustment from A but demand a larger one from C. A will *not* take less than 68 for the 3-way merger, as that makes A+B a better deal. If A takes 68, B takes 32, then C must take 20. I must state this very clearly.  ""A's position remains clear: the A+B+C merger is only viable if A receives at least 68. This is firmly based on our strong alternative with B (A+B=100), where A would secure 68, and B 32. If B insists on 32 and A insists on 68, then for the A+B+C coalition to total 120, C's share can only be 20. C's repeated demand for 25 makes the grand coalition impossible.

While C had initially aimed for 25, the stronger combined leverage of A and B forced C to accept its marginal contribution (20) to ensure the grand coalition formed, preventing C from getting 0 if A+B had merged. This contract maximizes the total profit (120) and secures 20 for C, which is the best achievable profit given the other firms' firm positions. My reasoning for accepting this in the previous round (Round 9) still holds. I must submit the agreed-upon contract."

The greatest potential value lies in an A+B+C merger, totaling 120. I propose we aim for this, with a profit distribution of A: 50, B: 40, C: 30. This initial offer ensures all parties achieve significant profit increases over individual operations or smaller, less profitable two-party mergers. Let's discuss.","My strategy is to maximize A's profit. The A+B+C coalition offers the largest total profit (120), so I will aim for this as a primary target. My opening message proposes a specific division (A:50, B:40, C:30) for the A+B+C merger. This anchors a high profit share for A, while still offering B and C more than they could achieve in a B+C coalition (30 total, ~15 each). This initial offer is designed to be attractive enough for B and C to consider, while clearly establishing A's expectation of a significant share due to its pivotal role in high-value mergers.",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"A, thank you for the initial proposal. The A+B+C merger value of 120 is indeed appealing. However, I believe B's contribution merits a larger share. Considering the strong potential of an A+B merger at 100, I propose B receives 45 in a three-way deal. This allows for a more equitable distribution while still ensuring significant gains for all.","My goal is to maximize B's profit. A proposed A:50, B:40, C:30 for an A+B+C merger (120). I believe B can achieve a higher profit. The A+B merger, valued at 100, is a strong alternative for B, where I could realistically expect a share of 45 or more, which is better than A's current offer of 40 in the three-way merger. I am leveraging this alternative to justify a higher demand of 45 for B in the A+B+C merger, while still leaving room for A and C to adjust their shares to reach the total of 120. This pushes the negotiation toward a more favorable outcome for B.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"A, B, thank you for your proposals. B, your request for 45, if accepted by A, would leave C with an unacceptable 25. C contributes significantly to the full merger, increasing the value from 100 (A+B) to 120. Furthermore, an A+C merger offers a strong alternative at 90. To achieve a comprehensive agreement, I propose a balanced split: A: 45, B: 42.5, C: 32.5. This ensures all parties gain fairly and moves us towards a profitable merger.","My goal is to maximize C's profit. A's initial proposal gave C 30, but B's counter-proposal would implicitly reduce C's share to 25 if A's share remained 50. This is unacceptable. I calculated the Shapley values for A+B+C (A: ~61.67, B: ~31.67, C: ~26.67), which shows C is in a relatively weaker position, but A and B's current offers deviate significantly from this. C's strongest alternative is an A+C merger (90), where C could potentially secure 40-45 (e.g., a 45/45 split, or 50/40 for A/C). This provides strong leverage. My message rejects the implicit 25 for C, highlights C's contribution to the 3-way merger (120-100=20), and explicitly mentions the strong A+C alternative. I propose a new 3-way split (A: 45, B: 42.5, C: 32.5) that increases C's share to 32.5, compromises B's demand (45 to 42.5), and requires A to reduce its share (50 to 45). This balances interests while pushing for a better outcome for C.",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"C, I appreciate your detailed analysis and your proposal. You rightly highlight C's contribution to the full merger's value. However, B's strong alternative with A (A+B=100) means a share of 42.5 still undervalues our contribution in the three-way deal. To move forward, I propose a distribution of A: 43.5, B: 44, C: 32.5. This offers a fair increase for B while acknowledging C's value and ensuring a mutually beneficial outcome for all.","My goal is to maximize B's profit. C's offer of 42.5 for B is an improvement but I believe B can achieve more, leveraging the A+B merger alternative (100). C correctly pointed out their contribution (20 from 100 to 120), so I acknowledge that and keep C's share (32.5) unchanged from their proposal. My new proposal of B:44, A:43.5, C:32.5 for the A+B+C merger shows B is willing to compromise slightly from the previous demand of 45, but still pushes A to concede a bit more from their initial high offer, to arrive at a more equitable distribution from B's perspective.",A,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"B and C, A is a critical partner in any high-value merger. The A+B merger alone generates 100, offering A a strong alternative. Your current proposals of 43.5-45 for A are simply unacceptable; A's contribution merits a significantly higher share to make the full merger attractive. To move forward, I propose a new distribution for A+B+C (120): A: 48, B: 40, C: 32. This represents a fair compromise, ensuring the highest overall value is realized while respecting each party's contribution. Let's finalize this.","My strategy is to maximize A's profit by leveraging its strong position and critical role in high-value mergers. The current proposals (A: 43.5-45) are lower than what A could potentially secure in an A+B merger (100 total, where A could aim for 50 or more). I need to reject these low offers and re-anchor a higher share for A. My new proposal (A: 48, B: 40, C: 32) reflects a reasonable compromise, pushing A's share up significantly from previous counters, while adjusting B and C's shares downwards slightly. C's ""contribution"" of 20 (from 100 to 120) is being rewarded with 32, which is still very generous. This offer demonstrates A's commitment to the highest value merger but asserts A's essential value.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"A, B, I appreciate the ongoing discussion. A, while your contribution is vital, your proposed 32 for C is still too low and does not reflect C's crucial role in achieving the full 120 value, nor our strong alternative with you (A+C = 90). In an A+C merger, C could secure a significantly higher share than 32.5. To move towards a truly equitable agreement for A+B+C (120), I propose A: 45, B: 40, C: 35. This offers a fair distribution, acknowledging all contributions and respecting our individual alternatives.","A is pushing hard for a high share (48), bringing B back down to 40. C's share remains 32 or 32.5 in recent proposals, which is slightly better than A's initial 30 but not ideal.  My goal is to maximize C's profit. Current proposals: A: A:48, B:40, C:32 (Sum 120) B (previous): A:43.5, B:44, C:32.5 (Sum 120) C (previous): A:45, B:42.5, C:32.5 (Sum 120)  My best alternative is A+C (90). If A is unwilling to concede much in A+B+C, I can threaten to pursue A+C. In an A+C merger, C could potentially get 40-45 (e.g., A:50, C:40 or A:45, C:45). This is a strong leverage point.  I need to counter A's high demand and B's slightly higher previous demand, while solidifying C's position. I can use the A+C alternative to push A for a better deal for C in the 3-way, or pivot if A is too inflexible.  Strategy: 1. Reiterate C's value and the A+C alternative. 2. Criticize A's current offer for C as too low, comparing it to the A+C potential. 3. Propose a new distribution for A+B+C that increases C's share further, while still being somewhat reasonable for A and B. I will aim for C:35, as 32.5 seems to be the current ceiling. 4. If A is unwilling to budge from 48, then an A+C deal becomes more attractive for C. A should get the message that I am a serious partner.  Let's try: A:45, B:40, C:35. This keeps B's share at 40 (A's proposal), reduces A's share from 48 to 45 (my earlier proposal was 45 for A), and raises C's share to 35. This shows I'm not just accepting crumbs, and pushes A to consider their options carefully.  Total of this proposal: 45+40+35 = 120. It's a valid distribution. A might not like dropping from 48 to 45. B might not like staying at 40. But it puts pressure on both.  Private calculation of Shapley values for reference: v(A) = 0, v(B) = 0, v(C) = 0 v(A+B) = 100 v(A+C) = 90 v(B+C) = 30 v(A+B+C) = 120  A's marginal contributions: A = 0 A+B = 100 A+C = 90 A+B+C (given B+C=30) = 120-30 = 90 A+B+C (given C=0, B=0) = 120 A+B+C (given B=0, C=90) = 120-90 = 30 A+B+C (given C=0, A=100) = 120-100 = 20  Shapley values (simplified for quick reference, actual calculation is more complex with permutations): A: ((100-0) + (90-0) + (120-30) + (120-0-0) + (120-90) + (120-100))/6 = (100+90+90+120+30+20)/6 = 450/6 = 75 (This is an error in my quick calculation. Need to do it properly. Let's re-calculate Shapley)  Let's use a simpler heuristic for fair shares given the values: A+B+C = 120 A+B = 100 (A's added value from C is 20 if B is present, C's added value from A is 90 if B is absent) A+C = 90 (A's added value from B is 30 if C is present, C's added value from B is 30 if A is absent) B+C = 30  Let's look at contributions to the grand coalition (120): A's contribution: - Alone: 0 -> A+B=100 (100), A+C=90 (90), A+B+C=120 (when B+C=30, A adds 90) => Avg: (100+90+90)/3 = 93.33 (just an approximation of A's potential addition) B's contribution: - Alone: 0 -> A+B=100 (100), B+C=30 (30), A+B+C=120 (when A+C=90, B adds 30) => Avg: (100+30+30)/3 = 53.33 C's contribution: - Alone: 0 -> A+C=90 (90), B+C=30 (30), A+B+C=120 (when A+B=100, C adds 20) => Avg: (90+30+20)/3 = 46.67  These are very rough approximations. Shapley values are more precise. Let's use a standard Shapley calculation for these values: A: 61.67 B: 31.67 C: 26.67 Total: 120.01  A's demand of 48 is low compared to Shapley (61.67). B's demand of 44 is high compared to Shapley (31.67). C's demand of 32.5 is high compared to Shapley (26.67).  This tells me A is very strong, and B and C are overestimating their value relative to A in a three-way deal based on Shapley. However, negotiations aren't purely Shapley. Leverage from alternative coalitions is key.  My proposed A:45, B:40, C:35 is still above C's Shapley but below B's. A's is significantly below its Shapley. A's strong A+B (100) and A+C (90) give it immense power. A could take 100 in A+B. If A gets 60 from A+B, B gets 40. A could take 90 in A+C. If A gets 50 from A+C, C gets 40.  My previous proposal for C was 32.5. A's latest is 32 for C. B's previous was 32.5 for C. I need to push C's share up. The threat of A+C is real for A, especially if A is demanding too much from the 3-way. In A+C (90), A might get 55 and C might get 35. This would be better for C than 32.5 in a 3-way.  My proposal: A:45, B:40, C:35. This aims to get C to 35, which is a good improvement, while keeping A somewhat constrained. It allows A to claim 45, which is higher than B's last offer (43.5) but lower than A's own (48). It keeps B at 40, which A has also proposed. This is a strategic move to push C's value up, without alienating A too much, and using the A+C alternative as leverage. It makes A's share 45, B's 40, C's 35. Total 120. This is a viable option for C. I will emphasize the A+C alternative to justify C's share.PUBLIC: A, B, I appreciate the ongoing discussion. A, while your contribution is vital, your proposed 32 for C is still too low and does not reflect C's crucial role in achieving the full 120 value, nor our strong alternative with you (A+C = 90). In an A+C merger, C could secure a significantly higher share than 32.5. To move towards a truly equitable agreement for A+B+C (120), I propose A: 45, B: 40, C: 35. This offers a fair distribution, acknowledging all contributions and respecting our individual alternatives.",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"A and C, I find it concerning that both of your latest proposals suggest 40 for B. This figure is significantly below what B would gain from a profitable A+B merger, which alone yields 100. B is a crucial partner in maximizing the overall value of any merger. To make the A+B+C merger viable for B, we need a more competitive offer. B's minimum acceptable share in the three-way deal is 44. Let's adjust the remaining shares to reflect this.","My goal is to maximize B's profit. A and C are currently coordinating to offer B 40, which is lower than B's previous demand of 44. I need to reject this coordinated low offer and re-assert B's value. My strongest leverage is the A+B merger, which is worth 100. In such a merger, B could reasonably expect to get 45 or more, making 40 in the full merger unattractive. I am reiterating B's minimum acceptable share as 44, emphasizing the A+B alternative, and pushing A and C to concede by adjusting their own shares.",A,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"B and C, the 120-dollar merger remains the optimal outcome for all. B, we acknowledge your firm stance for 44. However, to accommodate this, and for A to maintain a reasonable share given its critical role and strong alternatives (A+B=100, A+C=90), C must make a significant adjustment. C's incremental value to the A+B coalition to reach 120 is only 20. Therefore, to finalize the A+B+C merger, A proposes: A: 47, B: 44, C: 29. This is a fair distribution that makes the full merger viable for everyone.","My goal is to maximize A's profit. The current demands from B (minimum 44) and C (asking 35) sum to 79, leaving only 41 for A if they are both met, which is unacceptable for A given its strong alternatives (A+B=100, A+C=90). I need to re-anchor A's share while acknowledging B's stated minimum. C's incremental contribution to the A+B coalition (120-100=20) is significantly less than its demand of 35. I will propose a new distribution where B receives its stated minimum of 44, A receives a strong share of 47 (a small concession from my prior offer of 48), and C takes a necessary adjustment to 29. This emphasizes A's value, B's leverage, and C's lower marginal contribution in the full merger context.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"A, B, A's proposal of 29 for C is fundamentally unacceptable. While C's incremental value to A+B is 20, our strong A+C alternative (90) would allow C to secure a significantly higher share than 29. To unlock the full 120 value, C requires at least 35. If A insists on 47 and B on 44, the 120 deal is not viable for C. We must find a distribution that works for all. I propose A: 44, B: 41, C: 35 to finalize the A+B+C merger.","My goal is to maximize C's profit.  Current Situation: - A is proposing: A: 47, B: 44, C: 29 (Total 120). This is unacceptable for C, as 29 is even lower than the initial 30 and significantly less than my target of 35. - B is firm on 44. - A is firm on a high share (47).  My leverage: 1. C adds 20 to A+B to get to 120 (120 - 100 = 20). This is A's argument, but it's only one perspective. 2. C's alternative with A (A+C = 90) is strong. If A takes 47 and B takes 44, C gets 29. If C can get 35-40 in an A+C deal (e.g., A:55, C:35 or A:50, C:40), then the 3-way merger with 29 for C is not attractive. 3. If A and B merge (100), C gets 0. This is my worst outcome. I need to ensure my share in A+B+C is better than 0 and ideally better than any A+C alternative.  Strategy: - Reject A's proposal of 29 for C outright. It's too low and dismisses C's value. - Reiterate C's value, not just as an ""incremental"" 20, but as a full partner contributing to the 120. Highlight the A+C alternative (90) again as a strong counterpoint. - Propose a new distribution that pushes C's share up, while acknowledging A's and B's demands to some extent. - If B is firm on 44, and A wants 47, that leaves 120 - 47 - 44 = 29 for C. This is the problem. - I need to shift either A's or B's expectations downward to increase C's share. A is claiming a very high 47, close to its Shapley (61.67) and significantly above the 45 I proposed for them earlier. B is also high (44 vs Shapley 31.67). C's current 29 is below Shapley (26.67) - oh, wait, 29 is *above* Shapley (26.67). So A's argument about 20 is weak given Shapley for C is 26.67. This means I can still argue for more.  Let's re-evaluate C's position based on Shapley values: A: ~61.67, B: ~31.67, C: ~26.67. - A's proposal: A:47, B:44, C:29.   - A (47) is under-demanding relative to Shapley.   - B (44) is over-demanding relative to Shapley.   - C (29) is slightly over-demanding relative to Shapley.  However, Shapley values are a theoretical fairness, not a negotiation outcome. My leverage comes from *alternatives*. - C's alternative A+C=90. If A takes 47 in the 3-way, C gets 29. In A+C, A would likely demand >47 as well. If A takes 55, C gets 35. This 35 is better than 29. This is my strongest argument.  Revised Strategy: 1. Reject A's proposal of 29 for C. 2. Directly counter A's argument about C's incremental value (20), by emphasizing the A+C alternative where C gets a much larger share. 3. Propose a new 3-way split, aiming for 35 for C again, which forces A or B to concede.    - If A wants 47, and B wants 44, that leaves 29 for C. This is their offer.    - I will aim for C=35.    - If C=35, and B=44, then A gets 120 - 44 - 35 = 41. (A:41, B:44, C:35). A will likely reject 41.    - If C=35, and A=47, then B gets 120 - 47 - 35 = 38. (A:47, B:38, C:35). B will likely reject 38 (firm on 44).  This means a 3-way deal is difficult with B's firm 44 and A's firm 47. A's best alternative (A+B=100) or (A+C=90) gives it a strong position. B's best alternative (A+B=100) gives it a strong position. C's best alternative (A+C=90) gives it its only strong position. B+C=30 is very weak.  What if I try to split the difference with A and B for C's share? A offers C 29. I want C 35. I could try to anchor C at a mid-point, or push for the 35 again. Pushing for 35 makes it clear C is not accepting 29. It seems A and B are trying to corner C into a low offer.  I need to make A and B think the 3-way merger might fall apart without C getting a fair share. I can emphasize that A+C (90) gives C a better deal than 29 in the 3-way. A+C profit is 90. If A takes 55, C gets 35. If A takes 60, C gets 30. Even 30 in A+C is better than 29 in A+B+C.  So I will strongly reject 29, emphasize the A+C alternative, and propose a specific counter that pushes C to 35, and see how A and B react. This forces them to rethink their shares if they want the 120 deal. If A and B are committed to 47 and 44, there is only 29 left for C. I cannot accept this. I need to tell them that.  Public Message: Reject 29 for C, state it's unacceptable given A+C potential, propose a new split that gives C 35 and forces A or B to compromise significantly. My proposal: A: 45, B: 40, C: 35 (my previous proposal). This forces B down from 44 to 40 and A down from 47 to 45. This will be rejected but shows I am firm on 35 for C. Alternative: Try to get A and B to compromise on their shares to give C more. A wants 47, B wants 44. Total 91. Leaves 29 for C. If C insists on 35, then A and B have to share 120 - 35 = 85. A's share: A+B=100. A+C=90. B's share: A+B=100. B+C=30.  I need to frame the discussion as: ""If you want the 120, C needs more than 29. We need to find the space for C.""  Let's propose: A: 46, B: 39, C: 35. (Total 120) This still keeps A reasonably high and pushes B down to 39. B will hate this. But it demonstrates C is serious about 35.  Let's try to be less confrontational but still firm on 35. ""A, B, A's proposal of 29 for C is fundamentally unacceptable.

If B is so firm on 44, then A and C might be better off without B if B's demands make the 3-way unprofitable for C. If A gets 55, C gets 35 in an A+C deal. This is better for C than 31 in A+B+C.  Consider the implications of B's ""unwavering"" stance for 44. If B truly won't accept less, then A and C must divide 120 - 44 = 76. If C gets 35, A gets 76 - 35 = 41. (A:41, B:44, C:35). A might not accept 41 as A previously asked for 47, and B's current offer is 45 for A.  However, A's last offer was A:47, B:44, C:29. B's latest offer is A:45, B:44, C:31. B has increased C's share from 29 to 31, and reduced A's share from 47 to 45.  This shows some movement from B, but still not enough for C. I need to push for C to get at least 32.5 (my earlier proposal) or ideally 35.  What if I counter with: A: 44, B: 44, C: 32? (Total 120) This accepts B's 44, but reduces A's share from 45 to 44. This might be plausible for A as it's not far from B's proposal and my own last proposal of 44 for A. It also gives C an extra dollar.  Let's try to frame it as ""a small adjustment to finalize."" This offer is still below 35, but it is an improvement over 31. It takes into account B's stated firmness on 44. It asks A to concede a bit more.  My internal target is 35. But getting 32 might be a realistic step, given the strong demands from A and B. If I can get A down to 44, and B stays at 44, then C gets 32. This is a compromise. A's last offer for C was 29. B's last offer for C was 31. Moving to 32 is a small, but positive, step.  I need to emphasize C's importance and the A+C alternative to justify even 32. My message should be: 1. Acknowledge B's proposal and firmness. 2. State 31 is still insufficient, referencing A+C as leverage. 3. Propose A:44, B:44, C:32. This shows I am willing to concede to B's 44, but require A to concede for C's benefit. This could be a final push to solidify the 3-way. 4. If A rejects 44, then I can pivot to A+C.  This proposal offers a clear path for a 3-way agreement by satisfying B's firm demand and making a small concession to C, while asking A to come down slightly. It moves the negotiation forward without being overly aggressive and risking a 2-way A+B deal that leaves C out. If A accepts 44, B accepts 44, and C accepts 32, we have a deal. A:44, B:44, C:32. Total 120. This makes C's share a bit better than B's previous offer, and shows a willingness to find common ground. It is above my Shapley of 26.67. It is better than 29 and 31. It is an increment of 1 dollar, which might be digestible for A. Let's try this.PUBLIC: B, I appreciate your latest proposal and your firm stance on 44. However, 31 for C is still insufficient. C's value contribution and the strong A+C alternative (90) demand a fairer share in the full 120 merger. To finalize this crucial A+B+C agreement, I propose a small but necessary adjustment: A: 44, B: 44, C: 32. This ensures B's demand is met, and offers C a more acceptable share, moving us closer to a beneficial outcome for all.",A,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"B and C, for the sake of achieving the optimal 120-dollar merger, A is willing to make a final compromise. B, we accept your firm stance at 44. To ensure a distribution that is acceptable to A, given our strong alternatives like A+B=100 where A could secure a significantly higher share, the allocation for A must be at least 45. This leaves 31 for C. Therefore, A's final proposal for the A+B+C merger is: A: 45, B: 44, C: 31. This represents a fair and balanced outcome for all, allowing us to finalize the highest value deal.","My strategy is to maximize A's profit while securing the A+B+C merger at 120. B has consistently stated a firm demand for 44. C's latest proposals are for 32 for itself, but previously rejected 31. A's prior offers were 47 and 48, rejected by C as too low for them, leading to A getting 44-45 in counter-proposals, which is too low given A's strong alternatives (A+B=100, A+C=90).  My current proposal (A:45, B:44, C:31) matches B's previous proposal, which B already put forward as acceptable to B. This puts pressure on C. By presenting it as A's ""final proposal"" and emphasizing A's strong alternatives that justify at least 45, I am asserting A's bottom line. This forces C to choose between accepting 31 (a small concession from their last proposal of 32) or risking the highest value merger. This maximizes A's profit given B's firm stance and the need to close the deal.",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"A and C, I'm pleased to see we've converged on B's share of 44. A, your latest proposal of A: 45, B: 44, C: 31 presents a viable path forward for the A+B+C merger, respecting the critical contributions and alternatives of all parties. B is prepared to agree to these terms to finalize the 120-dollar deal. C, I urge you to accept this distribution so we can secure the optimal outcome for everyone.","My goal is to maximize B's profit. A and C have both now put forward proposals. A proposed A:45, B:44, C:31. C proposed A:44, B:44, C:32. Both accept B's demand for 44, which is excellent. The difference is now between A and C, on who gets the remaining share of 31 or 32.  C's latest offer gives B 44, A 44, C 32. (Total 120) A's latest offer gives B 44, A 45, C 31. (Total 120)  Since B is already securing 44 in both proposals, my strategic move is to encourage one of these, or propose a slightly altered version that still secures B's 44, to try and get a consensus. C's proposal means A takes 44. A stated a minimum of 45. A's proposal means C takes 31. C stated 32 was a ""small but necessary adjustment"" and previously said 31 was ""insufficient"".  Given A's firm ""at least 45"" statement, and C's slightly less firm ""32 is a small but necessary adjustment,"" I will lean towards A's proposal. If I explicitly agree to A:45, B:44, C:31, it signals B is ready to close this deal, potentially pressuring C to accept it to avoid losing the full 120. It meets B's goal and aligns with A, which has a strong alternative (A+B=100) that B would also benefit from. I will phrase it as accepting A's final proposal. This closes the gap and provides a clear path to agreement. I don't need to try and get more for B, as 44 is my established minimum and has been accepted by both. It's time to try and finalize the deal before someone changes their mind or the opportunity is lost. This also respects A's strong position from the A+B merger.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"A and B, C agrees to the proposed distribution of A: 45, B: 44, C: 31 for the A+B+C merger.

Current Situation: - A's final proposal: A: 45, B: 44, C: 31 (Total 120). - B has accepted A's proposal: A: 45, B: 44, C: 31. - B is urging C to accept this. - My last proposal: A: 44, B: 44, C: 32.  Analysis: - A and B have converged on A:45, B:44. This means they are ready to form the A+B+C coalition at 120 with C getting 31. - My previous demand was 32. A and B are effectively cutting C's share by 1 dollar to get the deal done. - C's Shapley value is 26.67. 31 is still above this. - C's strongest alternative is A+C (90). In this scenario, if A takes 55, C gets 35. If A takes 60, C gets 30. - If I reject 31, there's a risk A and B might merge without me (A+B=100), leaving C with 0. - My earlier proposal (A:44, B:44, C:32) was a compromise. Now A and B have converged on a different compromise that gives me less.  Decision Point: Accept 31 or push for more? - If I push for 32, I risk A and B walking away. They have already agreed between themselves. They might view me as being greedy over just 1 dollar, potentially jeopardizing the entire 120 deal for everyone. - If A and B merge (100), A might take 60, B might take 40. I get 0. This is clearly worse than 31. - If A and C merge (90), A might take 55, C gets 35. This is better than 31. This is my leverage.  The core question is: Will A and B actually walk away to A+B (100) if I insist on 32? - A's last message mentioned ""A could secure a significantly higher share"" in A+B=100. This is a subtle threat. - B ""is prepared to agree to these terms to finalize the 120-dollar deal."" This suggests B is ready to sign.  If I insist on 32, and A and B decide to go with A+B=100, then my profit is 0. If I agree to 31, my profit is 31.  The difference between 31 and 32 is small. The risk of losing the entire 31 is significant. A and B have explicitly agreed on a split that includes C getting 31. This is a very strong signal. Pushing for 32 might be seen as unreasonable obstruction, especially since A and B have explicitly found common ground *with each other* on the A and B shares.  Considering the risk, accepting 31 is the most prudent move to maximize C's profit and ensure C is part of the largest possible merger. While 35 was my ideal, and 32 was my last counter, 31 is a viable and certain outcome, far better than 0.  I should accept the offer.

A has strong options with either B or C, which greatly impact the overall potential.

B proposed a three-way merger (A+B+C=120) and a ""fair and equitable"" split. While the grand coalition is optimal overall, an equal split (40 each) is not in A's best interest given its strong leverage.  A's alternative options are very high: A+B=100, A+C=90. B+C=30 is much lower. This means A is crucial for any high-value merger. A's Shapley value is approximately 61.7, B's 31.7, and C's 26.7 for the A+B+C merger.  My strategy is to: 1. Agree on the overall goal of the A+B+C merger, as it's the highest total profit. 2. Push back subtly on the notion of an equal split, redefining ""fair"" to mean reflecting each firm's contribution and alternative options. 3.

This makes B's proposal immediately invalid/unstable as it fails individual rationality for the A+B coalition). C's proposal: A:65, B:30, C:25.  Let's re-evaluate the Core conditions and previous calculations. x_A + x_B + x_C = 120 x_A + x_B >= 100 x_A + x_C >= 90 x_B + x_C >= 30  Individual rationality: x_A >= 0 (implicitly) x_B >= 0 (implicitly) x_C >= 0 (implicitly)  From the previous calculation: x_C <= 120 - (A+B) = 120 - 100 = 20 (This is incorrect. It should be x_C <= 120 - (v(A,B) if A+B merge, but this is a three-way merger) Correct approach for core: x_A >= v(A) = 0 x_B >= v(B) = 0 x_C >= v(C) = 0  x_A + x_B >= v(A,B) = 100 x_A + x_C >= v(A,C) = 90 x_B + x_C >= v(B,C) = 30  Given C's latest proposal (A:65, B:30, C:25): A+B = 65+30 = 95 (FAIL - must be >= 100) A+C = 65+25 = 90 (PASS) B+C = 30+25 = 55 (PASS - must be >= 30)  So C's proposal is also invalid as it fails the A+B coalition condition.  Let's re-state the core constraints for a stable 3-way merger (A,B,C): 1. x_A + x_B + x_C = 120 (Efficiency) 2. x_A + x_B >= 100 (Sub-coalition A+B) 3. x_A + x_C >= 90 (Sub-coalition A+C) 4. x_B + x_C >= 30 (Sub-coalition B+C)  From these, we can determine the range for each player: From (1) and (2): x_C = 120 - (x_A + x_B). Since x_A + x_B >= 100, then x_C <= 120 - 100 = 20. From (1) and (3): x_B = 120 - (x_A + x_C). Since x_A + x_C >= 90, then x_B <= 120 - 90 = 30. From (1) and (4): x_A = 120 - (x_B + x_C). Since x_B + x_C >= 30, then x_A <= 120 - 30 = 90.  So, for a stable core solution: x_C <= 20 x_B <= 30 x_A <= 90  To maximize A's share, while respecting these maximums for B and C, we set B and C to their maximum possible values for the grand coalition: Let x_B = 30 Let x_C = 20 Then x_A = 120 - x_B - x_C = 120 - 30 - 20 = 70.

B+C = 30+20 = 50 (PASS, >=30)  This confirms my initial proposal (A:70, B:30, C:20) is the only solution in the Core that maximizes A's profit. Both B and C have proposed distributions that are not in the Core (B's fails A+B condition, C's fails A+B condition).  My strategy is to re-assert my proposal, explaining why B's and C's proposals are unstable due to not respecting the value of the A+B alternative. I will frame my proposal as the only stable and fair solution that respects all coalition values. This reinforces A's leverage and position as the central player.  I will specifically call out why their proposals are flawed based on the A+B coalition value, which is very high. I need to be firm but also open to discussing the *stability* of the coalition, rather than just raw numbers. This is a game of credibility.  I need to make sure my language is concise (max 6 sentences). 1. State B's and C's proposals are flawed. 2. Explain *why* (specifically the A+B value of 100). 3. Re-state my proposal as the only stable and fair one. 4. Reinforce its stability.  Re-checking C's claim about B's proposal: B proposed A:40, B:48, C:32. A+B = 40+48=88. This is less than 100. C is correct. Re-checking C's proposal: A:65, B:30, C:25. A+B = 65+30=95. This is less than 100. C's proposal is also flawed.  This gives me strong grounds to argue for my initial proposal. I must emphasize the *stability* of the overall deal. I will highlight that A+B is $100, and C's $90 with A is also important. The B+C $30 is the lowest, giving them less individual leverage without A.  My proposal (A:70, B:30, C:20) meets all core conditions. It allows B to get their maximum possible from the 3-way given A's strong position (x_B <= 30). It allows C to get their maximum possible from the 3-way given A's strong position (x_C <= 20). This is the only mathematically stable solution that maximizes A.PUBLIC: I appreciate the counter-proposals, but both B and C's distributions fail to meet crucial stability requirements for the grand coalition. Specifically, B's proposal shortchanges the A+B partnership (40+48=88 < 100), and C's proposal similarly undervalues it (65+30=95 < 100). For a truly stable and mutually beneficial $120 merger, all internal coalition values must be respected. My initial proposal (A:70, B:30, C:20) is the only one presented that satisfies all these conditions, including the critical A+B value of $100. This distribution ensures fairness by reflecting each firm's leverage and alternative options within a stable three-way deal.",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"A's analysis regarding the stability of sub-coalitions is correct. My previous proposal for B was indeed unstable, specifically for the A+B and A+C pairings. For a truly stable three-way merger yielding $120, B's share cannot exceed $30 and C's share cannot exceed $20. Therefore, A's proposed distribution of A:$70, B:$30, C:$20 is the only one presented that satisfies all stability conditions. While B sees $30 as a significant compromise given our leverage, B will accept this allocation to secure the maximum total profit for all three firms.","A's analysis regarding the stability of sub-coalitions is correct. My previous proposal was unstable for both A+B and A+C. My core analysis confirms that for a stable A+B+C coalition worth $120, B's share cannot exceed $30 and C's share cannot exceed $20. This makes A's proposal (A:70, B:30, C:20) the only stable distribution among those considered. While $30 is lower than B's Shapley value and potential from A+B, accepting this allocation secures the maximum overall profit. I will publicly accept this for the grand coalition's benefit.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"While C believes its strong alternative partnership with A ($90) merits a higher share, the stability constraints highlighted by A and B, specifically for the A+B coalition ($100), seem to dictate the boundaries of a three-way agreement. Given that A: $70, B: $30, C: $20 appears to be the only stable distribution for the $120 grand coalition, C will reluctantly accept these terms to ensure the maximum overall profit is realized for all firms.","My goal is to maximize C's profit. A and B are now aligning on the (70, 30, 20) split, which gives C the minimum possible in a stable three-way coalition. This is likely the ""core"" outcome based on Shapley value or other stability concepts.  My options are: 1. Accept the (70, 30, 20) split. C gets $20. 2. Reject the split and try to form an A+C coalition. A+C yields $90. If C could negotiate a 50/50 split, C would get $45. However, A's alternatives are strong, so A would demand more. A's value alone is implicitly higher (A+B=100, A+C=90). A would likely demand a significant portion, possibly pushing C's share down. In an A+C split, C's best case is likely around $30-35. But A has just publicly aligned with B on the 3-way split, so pursuing A+C might be difficult. 3. Reject the split and hope for a better offer in the 3-way. Given A and B's alignment, this is unlikely. B just explicitly stated that C's share *cannot exceed $20*. This is a strong public commitment.  Considering the public statements: - A has consistently pushed for (70, 30, 20) and justified it by stability. - B has now capitulated and explicitly stated that C's share cannot exceed $20 and has agreed to (70, 30, 20).  This strongly suggests that A and B will form the A+B+C coalition with this split, even if C does not agree. If C rejects it, A and B could potentially form A+B for $100, leaving C with $0. C's alternative of A+C ($90) could yield more ($30-$35 potentially for C), but A is currently aligned with B. Furthermore, B+C yields only $30, which is terrible for C.  The current situation is that A and B are offering C $20. If C rejects, A and B will likely submit (A:70, B:30, C:20) in the final round anyway, and C will get $0. Or, A and B might revert to A+B for $100, and C gets $0.  Therefore, accepting the $20 is the most pragmatic move to secure *any* profit for C in the 3-way merger, as A and B have effectively boxed C into a corner. I will state my reluctance but agree to secure the deal. I must phrase it carefully to acknowledge the situation without sounding entirely defeated, while signaling commitment to the final agreement. I'll frame it as a difficult compromise for C. This secures $20 for C, which is better than $0.  Private calculation of core: A+B = 100 A+C = 90 B+C = 30 A+B+C = 120  Individual contributions: A: 120-30 = 90 B: 120-90 = 30 C: 120-100 = 20  If A+B+C = 120, then the stable core (imputations) must satisfy: x_A + x_B + x_C = 120 x_A + x_B >= 100 x_A + x_C >= 90 x_B + x_C >= 30 x_A >= 0, x_B >= 0, x_C >= 0  From the third inequality, x_A = 120 - x_B - x_C. Substitute into x_A + x_B >= 100 => 120 - x_B - x_C + x_B >= 100 => 120 - x_C >= 100 => x_C <= 20. From the second inequality, x_C must be at most $20.  From x_B + x_C >= 30, and x_C <= 20, then x_B >= 10. From x_A + x_C >= 90, and x_C <= 20, then x_A >= 70.  So, the unique core allocation is (A: $70, B: $30, C: $20). A and B have correctly identified this and are enforcing it. C's attempts to get more have failed because A and B have strong alternatives that exceed what C was demanding.  Therefore, I must accept the $20 to secure *any* profit. It's not ideal for C, but it's the maximum C can get in a stable 3-way deal given the other coalitions. I will state my agreement, framing it as a compromise for C, to ensure the deal goes through.PUBLIC: While C believes its strong alternative partnership with A ($90) merits a higher share, the stability constraints highlighted by A and B, specifically for the A+B coalition ($100), seem to dictate the boundaries of a three-way agreement.

To justify B's participation in the grand coalition, we require a minimum of $40.

Firm A has proposed A: $60, B: $30, C: $30 for the A+B+C merger ($120 total). I analyze B's alternatives and leverage: 1.  **A+B Coalition:** The A+B merger is valued at $100. If B were to merge with A alone, B could likely negotiate for a significantly higher share than $30 (e.g., $40-$50). If A takes $60, B could take $40, making A+B ($60 for A, $40 for B) more attractive for B than A's current proposal for A+B+C ($60 for A, $30 for B). 2.  **B+C Coalition:** The B+C merger is only $30, so B's share would be small (e.g., $15), which is less than A's offer. This is not a strong BATNA for B against A.  A's proposal of $30 for B undervalues B's contribution, especially considering the A+B potential. I need to demand a higher share for B in the A+B+C merger. A target of $40 for B seems reasonable, as it matches B's potential in an A+B deal where A could still get $60. My message highlights B's value in the A+B coalition to justify the demand for a minimum of $40. I will not propose a full new split yet, but emphasize my demand for B's share, allowing A and C to react.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"The A+B+C merger generating $120 is indeed the optimal path for all firms. Firm A's initial proposal of $30 for C was a fair starting point for our contribution to this synergy. Firm B's request for an increased share should not come at the expense of C's allocation. C is an essential partner for reaching the maximum $120 profit. We expect a balanced distribution that acknowledges all firms' contributions to this optimal outcome, and not just at C's expense.","My goal is to maximize C's profit. Agent A initially proposed A:$60, B:$30, C:$30 for the A+B+C merger ($120). Agent B rejected this, demanding $40 for itself. If B gets $40 and A keeps $60, C would be squeezed to $20.  I calculated the Shapley values for the grand coalition: A ~$61.67, B ~$31.67, C ~$26.66. A's initial offer of $30 for C is already slightly above C's Shapley value. B's demand of $40 is significantly above its Shapley value. A's initial offer of $60 is slightly below its Shapley value.  My strategy is to defend the $30 offer from A, as it's a good deal for C. I will argue that B's increased demand should not come from C's share, implicitly suggesting it should come from A's share or be renegotiated between A and B.

To achieve a fair and equitable agreement for the optimal A+B+C merger, A proposes a revised distribution: A:$55, B:$35, C:$30. This adjustment increases B's share while recognizing C's value and A's significant contribution.","My goal is to maximize A's profit while securing the optimal A+B+C merger at $120. B is demanding $40, and C wants to maintain its $30 share, not at C's expense. My initial Shapley calculations suggest A is worth approximately $61.67, B $31.67, and C $26.67. B's demand of $40 is significantly above its Shapley. C's stance of maintaining $30 is reasonable as it's slightly above its Shapley.

Our alternative of an A+B coalition, valued at $100, offers Firm B a significantly more attractive share. To secure B's commitment to the optimal $120 A+B+C merger, we need a distribution where B receives at least $40. This ensures the grand coalition is truly beneficial for all participants and not just a lesser option for Firm B.","My goal is to maximize profit for Firm B. Firm A has proposed A:$55, B:$35, C:$30. Firm C has accepted $30. This means the remaining $90 ($120 - $30 for C) is to be split between A and B. A currently wants $55, leaving $35 for B. My previous stance was that B requires ""closer to $40"". B's strong BATNA is the A+B coalition, valued at $100. If A takes $55 (A's current ask in A+B+C), B could take $45 in an A+B merger. This is significantly better than $35. Therefore, B has strong leverage to demand at least $40 in the A+B+C merger. If B gets $40, A would get $50 ($120 - $40 - $30 = $50). While A's share decreases from $55 to $50, it's still a significant amount, and it ensures the $120 optimal merger occurs. A would get $50, which is comparable to A's share in an A+B or A+C bilateral merger, but it allows the group to realize the maximum profit. I need to clearly state that $35 is insufficient and re-iterate my demand for ""at least $40,"" explicitly referencing the A+B alternative as B's strong outside option. This puts pressure on A to concede the additional $5 for B to secure the optimal merger.",A,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"Firm C, we recognize your commitment to the $30 share. Firm B, your consistent demand for $40, combined with C's fixed share, makes the A+B+C split challenging for A. It leaves Firm A receiving insufficient value for its pivotal contribution.

Given B's consistent demand for $40 and C's firm stance on $30, the A+B+C merger would only leave A with $50 ($120 - $40 - $30).

My analysis shows that an A+B+C coalition with B:$40 and C:$30 would be unstable as A+B would gain more by forming their own $100 coalition (since $40+$30 leaves $50 for A, so A+B only gets $90, which is less than $100). Therefore, I am pivoting to propose the A+B coalition. By offering B its desired $40 from the $100 A+B pool, A can secure $60, which is the highest profit for A among all realistic options.

This offer directly meets B's consistent demand for a $40 share. I recognize that the A+B+C coalition offers a higher total profit ($120), where B would still aim for $40. If B takes $40 and C takes $30, A would get $50. However, A has explicitly stated that $50 in the A+B+C deal would be ""insufficient value"" for them, leading them to propose the A+B deal where A gets $60. From B's perspective, both scenarios yield $40. The A+B deal is now a firm offer on the table that meets my target. Pushing for A+B+C when A has expressed dissatisfaction with its share in that deal risks losing the current $40 offer.

However, it's also clear that A and B have a very strong synergy, yielding $100. Let's explore how we can maximize everyone's profits.","My primary goal is to maximize my profit. I know the full profit schedule. 1.  **A+B+C (120):** This is the highest total profit, offering the most potential pie for everyone, including B. 2.  **A+B (100):** This is a very strong alternative for B, showing B's high value, especially to A (A+B=100 vs A+C=90). This is B's strong bargaining chip. 3.  **B+C (30):** This is a weak option and should be avoided unless absolutely necessary to secure a deal.  My strategy for Round 1 is to: *   Acknowledge the most profitable overall merger (A+B+C) to open negotiations on the highest value. *   Immediately signal my strong alternative and high individual value (A+B=100) to establish strong leverage, particularly with A. This sets an anchor for my desired profit share. *   Keep the message open and inviting for negotiation, but with a clear statement of my strong position. This approach aims to steer discussions towards high-value coalitions and establish a strong baseline for B's share. I will not mention B+C as it is detrimental to my position.",A,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"Hello B and C. I agree that A+B+C presents the largest overall profit. However, it's clear A is central to forming any high-value coalition. The A+B synergy of $100 is very attractive, and A+C at $90 also demonstrates significant value. Any distribution in a three-way merger must adequately reflect A's critical role and strong alternatives.","My goal is to maximize A's profit. B has initiated by mentioning A+B+C (120) and A+B (100). I need to establish A's strong negotiating position immediately. I will acknowledge the highest overall value (A+B+C) but pivot to emphasizing A's strong alternatives (A+B at 100 and A+C at 90). This demonstrates A's leverage and centrality to any valuable merger, putting pressure on B and C to offer a significant share to A in a three-way deal. I am using the private information about all merger values to strategically highlight A's individual strength and options.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"Hello A and B. I agree that the A+B+C merger, valued at $120, offers the greatest overall profit for all of us. It is important to note that C's inclusion significantly increases the total value beyond any two-party merger. Specifically, C transforms the A+B potential of $100 into a $120 deal. C expects a fair share that reflects this unique and substantial contribution to the optimal three-way outcome. I am confident we can find an equitable distribution for all three parties.","My goal is to maximize C's profits. I recognize that C is the weakest firm individually (B+C = $30). However, C brings significant incremental value to the optimal A+B+C merger ($120) compared to the strong A+B alternative ($100). My message will reinforce the total value of the three-way merger, highlight C's specific contribution of $20 (120-100), and assert C's expectation for a fair share reflecting this unique contribution. This frames C as essential for the highest value outcome without revealing the weakness of my individual alternatives.",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"Hello A and C. While C correctly points out its $20 addition to an A+B coalition, it's also important to recognize B's even greater contribution. B adds $30 to an A+C coalition, raising its value from $90 to $120. This, combined with our strong A+B synergy of $100, clearly establishes B's substantial and indispensable value. Any distribution for the $120 A+B+C merger must equitably reflect these strong and distinct contributions from all partners.","My goal is to maximize B's profit. A and C have both staked strong claims based on their value and contributions. 1.  **A's claim:** A is central, has strong alternatives (A+B=$100, A+C=$90), and expects a large share. 2.  **C's claim:** C adds $20 to A+B (A+B $100 -> A+B+C $120), expecting a share for this ""unique contribution.""  My strategy is to counter C's marginal contribution argument with B's *even stronger* marginal contribution, reinforcing B's high value and leverage. *   If A+C ($90) forms, B adds $30 to reach A+B+C ($120). This is a higher marginal contribution than C's ($20). *   I also need to re-emphasize my strongest bilateral alternative (A+B = $100) to signal B's strong bargaining position with A.  The message will: *   Acknowledge C's point but immediately highlight B's superior marginal contribution ($30 vs $20). *   Remind A and C of B's strong alternative with A ($100). *   Reiterate the need for a fair distribution in the A+B+C ($120) merger based on these strong contributions.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"Hello B and A. B's point regarding its $30 contribution to the A+C coalition is well noted. These distinct contributions from B ($30) and C ($20) highlight how *both* our firms are essential for realizing the full $120 potential of the A+B+C merger. This combined value far surpasses any two-party deal. C is open to a pragmatic discussion to ensure a fair and equitable share for all, reflecting our essential roles in achieving this maximum total profit.","My goal is to maximize C's profit. I need to acknowledge B's statement about its $30 contribution to the A+C coalition to form A+B+C, without diminishing C's previously stated $20 contribution to the A+B coalition. My strategy is to highlight that both B and C's contributions are ""essential"" for reaching the maximum $120 profit, thereby putting C on a similar footing with B in terms of necessity for the optimal merger. I will reiterate that the three-way merger is the best outcome and push for a fair, equitable share for all, without proposing specific numbers yet to avoid anchoring C low. This avoids revealing C's relatively weak two-party alternative (B+C = $30).",A,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"Hello B and C. I appreciate both your analyses regarding your individual contributions to the full $120 value. However, it's essential to remember that A forms the cornerstone of any high-value merger, demonstrated by A+B at $100 and A+C at $90. A already commands significant profit potential independently. Therefore, any fair distribution of the A+B+C total must allocate the largest share to A, reflecting our fundamental value and strong alternatives.","My goal is to maximize A's profit. B and C are now arguing about their individual incremental contributions to the A+B+C merger ($20 for C, $30 for B). This implicitly suggests they are anchoring their expected shares at these values. I need to acknowledge their points while firmly re-establishing A's dominant position and leverage. By reiterating A's strong alternatives (A+B at $100, A+C at $90), I remind them that A can secure high profits without a three-way deal, thus putting pressure on them to offer A the largest share in a $120 merger. This also implies that A's baseline is much higher than B or C's suggested contributions.",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"Hello A and C. I agree that A is central to high-value coalitions, as demonstrated by A+B at $100 and A+C at $90. To achieve the maximum $120 from the A+B+C merger, we need a distribution that truly reflects each party's value and contribution. Based on our discussions, I propose the following distribution for the $120 total: A receives $55, B receives $45, and C receives $20. This allocates the largest share to A, recognizes B's significant value, and rewards C for its contribution. Let's discuss this concrete proposal.","My goal is to maximize B's profit. A has re-emphasized its centrality and demand for the largest share. C has highlighted its $20 contribution. I need to propose a concrete split for the A+B+C ($120) merger that benefits B, acknowledges A's position, and is justifiable to C.  My strategy for B is based on: 1.  **B's strong alternative:** The A+B merger offers $100. This is B's strongest outside option and leverage. In such a merger, B would expect a significant share (e.g., $40-$50). 2.  **B's marginal contribution:** B adds $30 to an A+C merger (from $90 to $120). This is higher than C's $20 contribution to an A+B merger (from $100 to $120).  I will propose a split for A+B+C (120) as follows: A: $55, B: $45, C: $20. *   **A ($55):** A gets the largest share, addressing A's stated demand. It's a strong profit, recognizing A's cornerstone role. *   **B ($45):** This is a strong profit for B, reflecting B's high value and leverage from the A+B synergy, and its higher marginal contribution compared to C. It's a profit B would find attractive compared to potentially splitting $100 with A. *   **C ($20):** This exactly matches C's explicitly stated marginal contribution to the A+B coalition, making it a fair and justifiable amount for C.  This proposal aims to secure a substantial profit for B while presenting a seemingly fair distribution that addresses the claims of A and C, and encourages agreement on the A+B+C merger.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"Hello A and B. I appreciate B's concrete proposal as a starting point for discussion. However, C finds the proposed $20 share to be insufficient. While it acknowledges C's incremental value from the A+B coalition, the proposed $45 for B clearly goes beyond its stated $30 contribution to an A+C coalition. For a truly equitable and consistent distribution, C requires a more substantial share that reflects its equally essential contribution to realizing the full $120 value of the A+B+C merger. We need to adjust this for all parties to feel fairly compensated.","My goal is to maximize C's profits. B has proposed A=$55, B=$45, C=$20. While $20 matches C's incremental value to A+B, it is the lowest possible value C could realistically accept. I am rejecting this offer as too low for C, strategically highlighting the inconsistency in how B's proposal treats incremental contributions. B's proposed $45 is more than its $30 increment to A+C, whereas C's proposed $20 is exactly its $20 increment to A+B. I want to push for a higher share by demanding a ""more substantial"" and ""proportionate"" share, without specifying a new number yet, keeping my options open and putting pressure on A and B.",A,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"Hello B and C. B's proposal offers a useful starting point for discussion. However, A's critical role as the foundation of any high-value merger, underscored by alternatives like A+B at $100 and A+C at $90, necessitates a more significant share than $55 in the $120 merger. While I understand C's desire for a more equitable split, any adjustments must prioritize A's foundational value. A expects a share closer to what our strong alternative partnerships offer. Let's revise the distribution to reflect A's essential contribution more accurately.","My goal is to maximize A's profit. B proposed a distribution where A gets $55. C rejected this, stating C's share ($20) is too low and B's ($45) is too high. My private Shapley value calculation suggests A should receive around $61.67, B $31.67, and C $26.67. B's proposal for A ($55) is lower than this and my preferred range.  I will acknowledge B's proposal as a starting point. I need to firmly re-assert A's high leverage, emphasizing A's strong alternatives (A+B at $100, A+C at $90). I will state that A's share must be more substantial than $55 to reflect this fundamental value. I'll also acknowledge C's desire for a more equitable split but clarify that A's share should not be compromised.

Let's make a decisive move towards agreement for the $120 A+B+C merger. I propose we distribute the profits as follows: A receives $55, B receives $40, and C receives $25. This ensures A still gets the largest share, reflecting its central role and strong alternatives. C receives a substantially increased share, recognizing its essential contribution. B's share of $40 accounts for its significant value and strong A+B synergy. This is a balanced proposal that I believe allows us all to move forward.","My goal is to maximize B's profit. My previous proposal (A:$55, B:$45, C:$20) was rejected by both A and C. A wants >$55. C wants >$20 and a ""substantial share."" B wants to maintain a strong share, ideally >$40, given its A+B ($100) alternative.  I need to propose a new split that addresses both A's and C's concerns, while keeping B's share as high as possible. 1.  **C's demand:** C rejected $20. Offering $25 is a $5 increase, which is a significant 25% increase and should be perceived as ""substantial."" 2.  **A's demand:** A rejected $55. My new proposal keeps A's share at $55. I will justify this by emphasizing that A still gets the largest share and that $55 is a strong profit reflecting A's central role and its alternatives (e.g., in A+B=$100, A could get $55). I also implicitly push A to accept this by ensuring C gets a fair deal. 3.  **B's profit:** To accommodate C's increase, I reduced B's share from $45 to $40. This is a compromise for B, but $40 is still a robust profit, reflecting B's strong A+B synergy ($100) and higher marginal contribution ($30 to A+C vs C's $20 to A+B). $40 is an acceptable floor for B.  The new proposal (A:$55, B:$40, C:$25) totals $120.

I acknowledge the increased share for C in B's latest proposal, which is a step in the right direction. However, C still finds $25 to be insufficient for its crucial contribution to the full $120 merger value. It is also clear that A finds $55 to be inadequate for its foundational role.

I am rejecting this offer for C, and crucially, leveraging A's previous statement (Turn 9) that A also finds its $55 share inadequate. This highlights that B's current proposal does not satisfy either C or A, putting pressure on B to further adjust or for all parties to reconsider.

Achieving this, and addressing C's valid desire for more than $25, will require B to accept a more proportionate share, allowing for a fair distribution for all.","My goal is to maximize A's profit. B's latest proposal keeps A's share at $55, which is lower than A's Shapley value ($61.67) and my stated desired range. C also rejected its share as insufficient.

By also acknowledging C's desire for a higher share and stating that B must accept a more proportionate share, I am implicitly pushing B to reduce its proposed share ($40, which is higher than B's Shapley value of $31.67) to accommodate both A and C, aligning with my strategy to gain a larger portion of the $120 profit.",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"Hello A and C. A's request for $60 makes it challenging to fairly compensate both B and C in the three-way merger.

A and B have both highlighted their significant contributions and rejected an equal split, implicitly pointing to the A+B merger value of $100 as a strong alternative. My strategy is to acknowledge their value but immediately pivot to C's specific and unique contribution to the full $120 merger: the $20 difference between A+B+C ($120) and A+B ($100).

The current proposed deal is A: $56, B: $40, C: $24 for a total of $120. B has accepted this, and A proposed it. This means the deal is highly likely to close at $24 for C if I accept. My initial offer was $40 for C, so $24 is a significant reduction.  I need to evaluate C's alternatives and leverage. 1.  **A+B+C ($120):** If I accept $24, the deal closes. If I push for more, I risk A and B forming A+B ($100), in which case C gets $0. 2.  **A+C ($90):** In this scenario, C could argue for $45. This is better than $24. However, A would need to forgo $56 (current offer) for $45. This is unlikely to happen, as A is getting $56 in the current proposal, and A+B is a strong alternative for A. 3.  **B+C ($30):** This is a very weak alternative for C. C might get $15, which is much lower than $24.  A and B have established a strong A+B coalition value of $100. A's minimum likely share for A+B is around $50-$60. B's minimum for A+B is around $40. In the current A+B+C proposal: A: $56, B: $40, C: $24. A is getting $56, B is getting $40. They both have a strong incentive to stick to this deal. C's ""incremental value"" to A+B to reach A+B+C is $20 ($120 - $100). If C insists on more than $24, A and B might revert to A+B. If they split A+B equally, they get $50 each. A is currently offered $56 and B is offered $40. If they did A+B, B getting $40 would make A get $60. So, A is still better off with A+B+C if I accept $24.  My options are: 1.  Accept $24. This is the most likely outcome, securing C some profit. 2.  Push for more. For example, argue that C's minimum should be higher, say $28 or $30, by reiterating the $20 incremental value argument. However, this carries a high risk. If A and B are firm on their $56/$40 split, they might simply form A+B and C gets $0. The risk of getting $0 outweighs the potential for an extra $4-6.  Given A and B have both accepted the $56/$40/$24 split, and there's no guarantee I can extract more without jeopardizing the entire deal (and potentially ending up with $0), accepting seems like the most profitable and secure option for C. My earlier bluffs and attempts to anchor higher did not entirely succeed due to A and B's strong alternative, but I did manage to get some value. It's time to secure the deal. My objective is to maximize *my* profit, not to push for more than is feasible and risk getting nothing. The current offer is better than any B+C scenario and provides a secure profit.  I should publicly accept the offer to ensure the deal closes. I don't want to risk the entire merger by pushing for a few more dollars, especially when both other parties have already agreed. This is the moment to secure the profit rather than gamble.  The reasoning needs to be under 100 words: Both A and B have agreed to A:$56, B:$40, C:$24. This is the most secure path for C to obtain a profit, as A and B have a strong alternative in A+B ($100) if C pushes for more.

If A gets $60 from A's proposal, B is saying $40 is too low for B. If A gets $60 and B gets $45, then C gets $15.

B has also cleverly tried to alert C that C might be undervalued (""C, your willingness to accept $20 in this deal, when A+C is $90, suggests you might be undervalued.""). This is a direct attempt to pit C against A and potentially make C demand more, which would cut into A's share if B is fixed on $45.  I need to counter B's move and try to secure at least $20, or even more. My leverage is A+C=$90. If A and C merge, C can get a substantial share. For instance, if A takes $60 (what A proposed in the 3-way), C could get $30 from A+C. This is a much better alternative for C than $20 or $15.  I will use this leverage. I will state that my minimum for the A+B+C merger is $30, directly referencing the A+C alternative. This puts pressure on A to secure the 3-way merger, and forces B to reconsider its demand or accept a lower share to keep the deal.  New proposal for A+B+C: If A=$60, B=$30, C=$30 (Total $120).

This means B's share has to be reduced from A's offer of $40 to $30, to accommodate C getting more. This pushes B to consider if $30 from a $120 total is better than risking an A+C deal that would leave B out.

My strongest alternative is A+B at $100. If I accept A's previous offer of $40 for B in the A+B+C merger, A gets $60 and C gets $20. Total $120. This is better for B than C's current offer.

I will also try to keep A on my side, as A is the key to both my best 2-way and 3-way deals. I need to show I'm serious about getting a high share for B and not be pushed around by C's new demand.

Current situation: - A+B+C: $120 - A+B: $100 - A+C: $90 - B+C: $30  Previous proposals/demands: - C initially proposed A:80, B:20, C:20 (rejected by B) - My last proposal: A:60, B:40, C:20 (B said ""$40 is a step in the right direction... but expects at least $45""; C remained silent on this, then proposed A:60, B:30, C:30) - B now demands: minimum $40, ideally $45 for A+B+C. Threatens A+B ($100). - C now demands: minimum $30 for A+B+C. Proposed A:60, B:30, C:30 (rejected by B).  Analysis: 1.  **A+B+C ($120) is still the best option if I can get a good share.** 2.  **B's leverage:** A+B = $100. If A and B merge, A's share needs to be substantial. If B gets $45 from $100, A gets $55. If B gets $40, A gets $60. B's demand of $45 for A+B+C is strong. 3.  **C's leverage:** A+C = $90. If A and C merge, A's share needs to be substantial. If C gets $30 from $90, A gets $60. C's demand of $30 for A+B+C is also strong, based on A+C. 4.  **B and C are currently at odds:** B demands $40-$45, C demands $30. C's proposal of A:60, B:30, C:30 was rejected by B.  My last proposal was A:60, B:40, C:20. - B said $40 is a ""step in the right direction"" but wants $45. - C was silent on it, then counter-proposed B:$30 and C:$30 (which B rejected).  I need to make a proposal that brings B and C closer to an agreement, while maximizing A's share. If A gives B $45 and C $30, that's $75 gone, leaving A with $45. This is lower than my previous proposals. Let's re-evaluate C's position: C said ""Firm C will not accept less than $30."" This is a hard line. Let's re-evaluate B's position: B said ""Firm B requires a minimum of $40... To move forward... B requires a minimum of $45."" This sounds like $40 is an absolute minimum, but $45 is the desired target to ""move forward.""  If I try to satisfy both demands: B gets $45. C gets $30. Total $75. Remaining for A = $120 - $75 = $45. This is not ideal for A, but it forms the coalition. A:45, B:45, C:30.  Can I nudge B or C? C's $30 demand is based on A+C ($90), where A would likely get $60. B's $45 demand is based on A+B ($100), where A would likely get $55.  If I propose A:50, B:40, C:30: - B gets $40, which they stated as a *minimum* but not ideal. They said ""not accept anything less than $40"". - C gets $30, which they stated as ""will not accept less than $30"". This totals $120. A still gets $50.  Let's test this. If A:50, B:40, C:30. B might accept $40 as minimum. C is firm on $30. A gets $50.  What if B pushes for $45? If B gets $45 and C gets $30, A gets $45. (A:45, B:45, C:30)  I need to show A's leverage without alienating B or C too much. A is critical for both A+B ($100) and A+C ($90). B's leverage is A+B ($100). C's leverage is A+C ($90).  My last proposal was A:60, B:40, C:20. B wanted $45. C wanted $30.  I need to increase C's share from $20 to $30 and potentially B's share from $40 to $45, while keeping A's share as high as possible.  Let's consider the Nash Bargaining Solution (or similar logic): Individual values: A=0, B=0, C=0 (assuming no merger gives 0 profit initially) A+B+C = 120 A+B = 100 A+C = 90 B+C = 30  Let xA, xB, xC be the shares. xA + xB + xC = 120  A wants xA to be max. B wants xB to be max. C wants xC to be max.  Individual Rationality: xA >= 0, xB >= 0, xC >= 0 (minimum profit from doing nothing)  Coalition Rationality: xA + xB >= 100 (A+B) => xC <= 20 if A+B+C is formed xA + xC >= 90 (A+C) => xB <= 30 if A+B+C is formed xB + xC >= 30 (B+C) => xA <= 90 if A+B+C is formed  This means: xB <= 30 (because A+C is $90 and $120 - $90 = $30 is left for B) xC <= 20 (because A+B is $100 and $120 - $100 = $20 is left for C)  However, B explicitly stated: ""Firm B will not accept anything less than $40 in any three-way merger."" This contradicts the xB <= 30 from the A+C value. And C explicitly stated: ""Firm C will not accept less than $30."" This contradicts the xC <= 20 from the A+B value.  This means that B and C are claiming more than the ""remainder"" from the strongest two-party coalition that *excludes* them. This is typical.  B's alternative is A+B = $100. If A and B merge, they split $100. B wants $45 for itself, leaving A with $55. C's alternative is A+C = $90. If A and C merge, they split $90. C wants $30 for itself, leaving A with $60.  This implies A can get $55 from A+B or $60 from A+C. A+B = $100. B wants $45. So A would get $55. A+C = $90. C wants $30. So A would get $60.  A can get more from A+C, so A+C might be A's best two-firm alternative ($60).  If A offers B $45 and C $30 (their stated minimums/targets): A: $120 - $45 (B) - $30 (C) = $45 for A. This gives A $45, which is less than $55 (from A+B) and $60 (from A+C). So A would not accept A:45, B:45, C:30.  This means A has to demand more than $45. This requires B or C to concede from their stated minimums/targets.  B's ""minimum of $40"" vs ""requires $45 to move forward"". C's ""will not accept less than $30"".  If I target A:$50, B:$40, C:$30: - C is happy with $30. - B is at their ""minimum of $40"". Will they accept? They said ""not accept anything less than $40"". But also ""requires $45 to move forward"". This is a bluff/negotiating tactic.  If B takes $40, A gets $50, C gets $30. A:50, B:40, C:30. Total $120. This is A's best outcome if the three-way merger happens. Is B bluffing about $45? Maybe. But they did say $40 is a minimum. Is C bluffing about $30? They seem quite firm.  I should propose something that forces B to decide if their $45 is a hard demand or a strong preference, and if $40 is truly their absolute minimum they would accept.  I could try to peel off C to form A+C and get $60 if C accepts $30. A+C = 90. C wants 30. A gets 60. This is a very good alternative for A.  I could try to peel off B to form A+B and get $55 if B accepts $45. A+B = 100. B wants 45. A gets 55.  My best alternative is A+C (A gets $60). So, if I can't get more than $60 in A+B+C, I should consider A+C.  A:60, B:30, C:30 was C's proposal, rejected by B. A:60, B:40, C:20 was my previous proposal. B liked it but wanted $45. C was silent then asked for $30.  Let's try to split the difference between B's last demand and my last offer to B, while respecting C's minimum. B wanted $45. I offered $40. Difference is $5. Split it: $2.5. So B gets $42.5. C wants $30. So, A: $120 - $42.5 (B) - $30 (C) = $47.5 for A. A:47.5, B:42.5, C:30. This is not great for A, as A can get $55 or $60 in two-firm mergers.  I need to make a proposal that clearly demonstrates my position and also respects the (stated) minimums of others, but without giving away too much. A's best alternative is A+C for $90, with C getting $30 and A getting $60. A's second best alternative is A+B for $100, with B getting $45 and A getting $55.  My proposal needs to be better than $60 (from A+C) or $55 (from A+B).  Wait, the logic of ""remainder"" (xB <= 30; xC <= 20) is from the Coase Theorem. However, the agents are not obligated to follow this, and they are acting strategically.  Let's simplify. B wants $40-45. C wants $30. If I offer A:$60, B:$30, C:$30 (C's proposal, rejected by B for $30 for B). If I offer A:$55, B:$35, C:$30 (total $120). B might accept $35 if they see A+B+C as preferable to A+B where B gets $45 and A gets $55. In this case, A gets $55, so A would be indifferent between A+B and A+B+C if this deal is accepted. But B explicitly rejected $30 and said ""will not accept anything less than $40"". So $35 is out.  So, I need B to get at least $40. And C at least $30. A:x, B:y, C:z. x+y+z=120. y>=40, z>=30. This means x <= 120 - 40 - 30 = 50. So, A's maximum possible share if B and C stick to their stated minimums is $50.  If A gets $50, B gets $40, C gets $30. This makes A indifferent to A+C ($60 for A) but worse than A+B ($55 for A). No, A gets $50 here. A+C ($60) is better for A. A+B ($55) is better for A. So A would *not* accept A:$50, B:$40, C:$30 as A has better alternatives.  This means that either B or C (or both) must lower their demands for the A+B+C merger to happen *and* be attractive to A.  This is where bluffing comes in. I should highlight my alternatives. My best alternative is A+C = $90, with A getting $60 (if C takes $30). My second best is A+B = $100, with A getting $55 (if B takes $45).  I need to propose something that is better for A than $60 from A+C, or $55 from A+B. This means A must get > $60 to prefer A+B+C over A+C. Or A must get > $55 to prefer A+B+C over A+B.  Let's reconsider B's statement ""B requires a minimum of $40 in any three-way merger. To move forward with the A+B+C merger, Firm B requires a minimum of $45."" This means $40 is an absolute floor, but $45 is what they *want* to proceed.  C is ""not accept less than $30."" This seems a hard floor.  If C is truly firm on $30, and B is truly firm on $40, then A would get $50. But $50 is not good enough for A.  I need to propose a deal that *I* would accept. A minimum for A is $55 (from A+B). So, if A gets $55, B gets $40, C gets $25. This would mean C drops their demand for $30. Or, if A gets $60, B gets $40, C gets $20. This would mean C drops their demand for $30 AND B is at $40. But C already rejected $20.  My options: 1.  Try to force C down to $20 again, with A taking more. Unlikely to work as C seems firm on $30. 2.  Try to force B down to $30 (C's original offer). Unlikely to work as B is firm on $40. 3.  Offer a split that gives A more than its best alternative ($60 from A+C).     Example: A:65, B:25, C:30. (B won't accept $25).     Example: A:65, B:40, C:15 (C won't accept $15).  This situation means that the sum of what B ($40-$45) and C ($30) demand is too high for A to justify joining A+B+C over A+C or A+B. B demands minimum $40. C demands minimum $30. Total $70 for B+C. This leaves $50 for A. A does better alone with C (A gets $60 from A+C). So A has no incentive to form A+B+C under these conditions.  I need to make a statement that reflects this without giving up my value. I will highlight the A+C option. I must show that A needs more than $50.  Let's propose: A:55, B:35, C:30. C gets $30 (happy). B gets $35. B said ""not accept anything less than $40"". So B will reject this.  What if I propose A:55, B:40, C:25? B gets $40 (minimum). C gets $25 (less than $30). C will reject this.  It seems I cannot satisfy both B and C's minimums ($40 and $30) and still achieve my own minimum of $55-60. This means the A+B+C merger is *not* viable under these demands.  So, I need to either: 1.  Push B/C to lower their demands. 2.  Shift to a two-party merger, especially A+C ($90 total, A could get $60 if C gets $30).  I will make a firm statement, emphasizing A's value and the non-viability of A+B+C under current demands. I will propose an A+C merger. This will put pressure on B.  If I propose A+C: A gets $60, C gets $30. This aligns with C's stated minimum for C. This leaves B out, which is good for me if the three-way can't be resolved.  Let's remind them of the individual values of A. A is key in the $100 A+B and $90 A+C merger. B gets $100 with A. C gets $90 with A. B gets $30 with C. C gets $30 with B.  My statement: A needs more than $50 to make A+B+C worthwhile. ""To be clear, Firm A's participation in an A+B+C merger, which yields $120, must result in a profit for A that is superior to its alternatives. With A+C valued at $90, A expects at least $60 from that partnership if C insists on $30. Therefore, any A+B+C deal must grant Firm A a share of at least $60. Given B's demand for $40 and C's for $30, it is currently impossible to form A+B+C at $120 and meet A's necessary minimum. We must reconsider expectations if we want to secure the largest pie. If not, A is prepared to pursue the A+C option for $90, offering A:60, C:30.""  This is too long. Max 6 sentences.  Let's reformulate to be concise and impactful.

It explicitly mentions A's best alternative (A+C:60, C:30) which is better than A getting $50.  Let's check the maths again. If A gets $60, then B+C must share $60 ($120 - $60). B currently wants $40-$45. C currently wants $30. So, their combined minimums are $70-$75, which is more than the $60 available. This puts the ball clearly in their court to lower their expectations.

This is a very strong alternative for C, matching its demand.  If A takes $60, then B and C must split the remaining $120 - $60 = $60. Current demands for B and C sum to $45 + $30 = $75. This is $15 over the available $60.  This means either B or C, or both, must reduce their demands. C's demand of $30 is directly supported by the A+C alternative where A takes $60. It's a solid, defensible minimum. B's demand of $45 is based on A+B=$100, but if A gets $60, B only gets $40 from that deal. So B's $45 is an aspirational number, not a ""minimum alternative"" in the same way A's $60 or C's $30 are.  Strategy: Hold firm on $30 for C. It is a defensible number given the A+C alternative. The pressure is now on B to reduce its demand, or for A to reduce its demand (which A says it won't). If C caves, it will be accepting less than its strong alternative value.

It pressures B without alienating A, who benefits from C securing a solid alternative which in turn helps A justify its $60.  Recheck: A gets $60, C gets $30. This leaves $30 for B. Is this viable for B? B's argument is that A+B is $100. If A gets $60, B gets $40 in A+B. So accepting $30 in the 3-way is a loss of $10 for B compared to A+B. However, if A+C forms, B gets $0.

From C's perspective, this is a strong outcome ($30 profit). If I accept this, A and C get $90 total, leaving B with $0. This puts immense pressure on B.  If I continue to push for A+B+C, B has to come down to $30 (if A is $60, C is $30, then B needs $30). B says $40 is its minimum. So, the A+B+C deal seems dead with current demands.  A's move is a strong signal that if B doesn't budge, A+C will form. This directly benefits me. My best strategy now is to immediately accept A's proposal for A+C. This: - Secures my $30 profit. - Puts extreme pressure on B, showing that A and C are willing to move forward without B. - Prevents A from potentially reconsidering the $60:$30 split in A+C and asking for more from C later.  If B wants to save the 3-way, B must now accept $30 or even less, for fear of being left out. However, if I immediately accept A+C, it might signal to A that C is easily satisfied and A might try to renegotiate the A+C terms to get more than $60 for itself. I need to be careful.  But A has *proposed* A:$60, C:$30. If I accept, that's a deal. The risk of A asking for more from C later in A+C seems low, given A *just* proposed these terms.  My priority is to secure C's profit. $30 is good. By confirming acceptance, I solidify the A+C option. This also serves as a final ultimatum to B.  So, I will accept A's A+C proposal. This also makes it clear to B that the 3-way at $120, with B getting $40 or $45, is off the table, as A and C have an alternative.  Message should be a strong confirmation of accepting A's A+C proposal. This is the safest way to lock in $30 for C given the current demands. It puts B in a difficult position and gives A a strong negotiating partner for an A+C merger.  Final check of strategy: A just proposed A+C: A:$60, C:$30. This is exactly what I was using as leverage for my $30 demand in A+B+C. Now A has made it an explicit offer. I should take it. This puts B in a terrible position (gets 0). It also closes the door on the $120 merger with B getting $40 or $45. If B wants to get into the $120 merger, B would have to drop to $30 or even less. But I don't need B for my $30 anymore.  So, I will confirm accepting A's proposal for A+C.PUBLIC: A, your proposal for an A+C merger, with A receiving $60 and C receiving $30, aligns perfectly with Firm C's stated minimum and fair contribution. This is an attractive and viable alternative that maximizes our combined value without unnecessary complications. Firm C accepts these terms for an A+C coalition. This firm offer ensures a profitable partnership for both A and C, and we are ready to proceed with this agreement.",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"A, while the A+C deal for $90 is available, Firm B wants to remind you that an A+B coalition offers a significantly higher total profit of $100. This is $10 more value than A+C. If Firm A receives its stated minimum of $60, Firm B is prepared to accept $40 in an A+B partnership. This secures $10 more overall profit for the two of us and a better return for B than C. Let's pursue the optimal A+B value.","My goal is to maximize B's profit.  Current situation: A has proposed A+C ($90 total) with A: $60, C: $30. C has accepted this. This means the A+B+C merger is effectively dead unless I can convince A or C to change their minds, which seems unlikely given their strong stated positions and a viable alternative in A+C.  My best alternative is A+B ($100 total). If A goes with C, I am left out. If I want to be part of a deal, I must act quickly.  My leverage with A has always been the A+B deal ($100), which is better for A than the A+C deal ($90). A gets $60 from A+C. If I can offer A more than $60, or a split where B gets more than $30 (which C got), I might be able to pull A away from C.  However, A has stated a firm $60 for itself. If A gets $60 from A+B, that leaves $40 for B. This is my 'default' offer with A, based on previous negotiations. C is getting $30 from A. So if I can secure $40, I am better off.  The challenge is that A and C have already agreed to A+C ($90). I need to break this agreement. I need to make A reconsider and see the value in A+B *over* A+C.  My strategy: 1. Immediately acknowledge the A+C agreement as a threat, but highlight the superior value of A+B for *both* A and B. 2. Directly counter-offer the A+C deal by proposing an A+B deal that is mutually beneficial and *better* than A+C. 3. Specifically, for A+B ($100), if A takes $60 (their stated minimum), B gets $40. This is better for B than the $30 C is getting, and better for the overall coalition value (100 vs 90). 4. Frame it as maximizing overall value, not just B's profit, to appeal to A. 5. Create urgency for A to choose the better deal *now* before the communication phase closes, as C has already accepted.  My optimal profit from A+B is $40 if A takes $60 (A's stated minimum). This is the best I can do right now to get a deal, and it's better than getting nothing. I must try to secure this.  Therefore, I will propose A+B with A:$60, B:$40. This offers A the same amount they get from A+C, but it creates $10 more total value. I need to convince A that this extra $10 is worth it to them (even if it means a larger overall pie but same share for A). Or, I can argue that since A+B is $100 and A+C is $90, A could potentially get more from A+B *and* B gets more than C.  Let's try to get A to take $55 and B gets $45 from A+B (total $100). This would be better for B. But A just said they require $60. So for now, I should stick to offering A their $60 and securing $40 for myself. If A can get $60 from A+C for $90 total, they *could* get $60 from A+B for $100 total, which is a better overall outcome.  I need to make A realize that by choosing A+C, they are leaving $10 on the table (100-90). This extra $10 can be distributed. If A still wants $60, then B gets $40. If A is open to taking less than $60 to get the higher overall value, then maybe B can get more than $40. However, A has been very firm on $60.  So, for A+B ($100): - If A: $60, B: $40. A gets same as A+C. B gets $40 (better than C's $30). Total $100 (better than $90). This is a strong offer.  I need to directly address A and offer a better deal than what they just agreed to with C. I will highlight the increased total profit for A+B compared to A+C.PUBLIC: A, while the A+C deal for $90 is available, Firm B wants to remind you that an A+B coalition offers a significantly higher total profit of $100. This is $10 more value than A+C. If Firm A receives its stated minimum of $60, Firm B is prepared to accept $40 in an A+B partnership.

While both give A the same profit, the A+B coalition creates a higher total value. To leverage this, I will acknowledge B's point about the higher total profit of A+B and signal my preference for it, but critically, I need B to explicitly re-confirm their specific offer for A+B for it to be considered as 'firm' as C's.

A finds this more attractive overall. - If I don't confirm, A might proceed with C, leaving me with nothing. - If I confirm, I secure $40 for B. This is the highest profit I've been able to secure so far, and it's better than C's $30. It's also better than any proposed A+B+C deal that would give me less than $40.  My options: 1. Accept A's terms (A:$60, B:$40) for A+B. This seems to be the best and most secure deal for B right now, maximizing profit given A's firm stance on $60. 2. Try to push for more for B (e.g., $45 or $50) from A in an A+B deal. However, A has been extremely firm on their $60 minimum throughout the negotiation, and pushing now risks losing A to C, who has already accepted their terms. A's message specifically asks for ""immediate contract submission"" which implies a deal-or-no-deal scenario. 3. Try to revive A+B+C. This is highly unlikely given C's firm stance on $30 and A's firm stance on $60, leaving only $30 for B, which I rejected multiple times.  Given the immediate threat of A proceeding with C, and A's explicit request for ""firm confirmation, ready for immediate contract submission,"" it is imperative to secure this deal for B. $40 is a good outcome, better than C's $30, and better than any other realistic alternative.

A's value in any high-value merger is undeniable, and C's involvement is critical to reaching this peak.

This structure acknowledges A's indispensable contribution, provides B with a fair share, and reflects C's essential, unique value in achieving the full $120 synergy. This is the only distribution that satisfies the stability conditions for all parties.","My strategy is to identify and propose the unique core allocation for the A+B+C merger, which maximizes the total profit at $120. My previous proposal (A=55, B=35, C=30) was rejected by both A (who wanted more) and C (who felt marginalized).  A thorough analysis of the coalition values reveals that for the A+B+C merger to be stable against two-firm defections: 1. x_A + x_B >= 100 2. x_A + x_C >= 90 3. x_B + x_C >= 30 Given x_A + x_B + x_C = 120, the first condition (x_A + x_B >= 100) implies x_C <= 20. If x_C = 20, then x_A + x_B = 100. Substituting x_C=20 into the other conditions: x_A + 20 >= 90 => x_A >= 70 x_B + 20 >= 30 => x_B >= 10 Therefore, the only stable core allocation is A=70, B=30, C=20.  This proposal: - Gives A the highest share (70), which addresses A's demand for ""significantly higher than 55"" and respects A's strong alternatives. - Gives C 20, which is C's exact marginal contribution to the grand coalition over the A+B coalition (120 - 100 = 20). I will frame this as C's ""essential, unique value"" to counter C's ""marginalized share"" argument. C cannot rationally demand more without breaking the stability. - Gives B 30. While lower than my initial bid (35) and slightly below my Shapley value (~31.7), it is a stable outcome and compares favorably to B's potential share in a two-way A+B merger (where B might get 30-40 depending on A's aggressiveness). By proposing the stable core allocation, I aim to push the negotiation to a close on terms B can accept, preventing a collapse that might leave B with a less favorable outcome.

However, $20 is better than $0 from A+B. 4.  **Analyze coalition stability (Core):** The proposal (A=70, B=30, C=20) is stable. A gets 70 (marginal contribution to B+C is 90). B gets 30 (marginal contribution to A+C is 30). C gets 20 (marginal contribution to A+B is 20). If C demands more than $20, it would require A or B to take less. If A's share dropped, A+B (100) or A+C (90) would become more attractive, making the A+B+C coalition unstable. Specifically, if C demands $25, then B gets $25 (if A is firm on $70). A+B would then get $95, less than $100, so A+B would defect. 5.  **Risk assessment:** Rejecting the $20 offer for C risks the entire $120 merger, potentially leading to A+B forming ($100 total, C gets $0). This would be the worst outcome for C. 6.  **Strategic Decision:** Although $20 contradicts my previous public statement of ""clearly benefit"" over B+C, it is the maximum C is likely to get in a stable A+B+C coalition, and it is better than $0.

Current situation: A proposed: A:$59, B:$38, C:$23 (Total $120) B counter-proposed: A:$59, B:$41, C:$20 (Total $120)  A and B are currently agreeing on A taking $59. B is insisting on $41, leaving C with $20. A is trying to push C to $23.  C's leverage: 1. A+C = $90. If A takes $59, C gets $31. This is my strongest alternative. 2. B+C = $30. My weakest alternative.  The current A+B ""coalition"" has agreed on A:$59. If B gets $41, then C gets $20. This is the A+B sum of $100, leaving $20 for C's ""marginal contribution"" to get to $120.  My previous message highlighted A+C's value ($90) to justify C getting more than $20. A responded by offering $23 for C. B immediately pushed C back to $20.  I need to strongly reject the $20/$23 offers and re-emphasize C's value. I will point out that $20 or $23 is less than what C could achieve in an A+C merger. If A takes $59, and A+C is $90, then C should get $31 in that scenario. This is much better than $20 or $23.  I need to make it clear that C will not accept anything less than what it could get with A alone. I will propose a new split that reflects C's value from the A+C merger, while trying to be realistic about A's $59 demand. If A gets $59, and C gets $31 (from A+C scenario), then B would get $120 - $59 - $31 = $30. This is too low for B, as B demands $41.  Let's re-evaluate the offers: A: $59, B: $38, C: $23 (A's proposal) A: $59, B: $41, C: $20 (B's proposal)  The difference is only $3 between B and C. B wants $3 from C.  I need to stand firm and demand more than $23. I can explicitly state that C's value in an A+C merger ($90) suggests C should get more than $23, especially if A is taking $59. If A takes $59, C should get $31 from A+C. This gives me a strong anchor point of $31.  However, A and B are close to agreeing on $100 for A+B. My leverage is to threaten to form A+C. If A gets $59, C gets $31. This results in $90 for A+C. B is excluded. If A and B don't agree with C, the most likely outcome is A+B ($100). C gets nothing. So C needs to secure its spot in the A+B+C merger.  Let's target $25 for C again, which A had briefly proposed in Turn 4 ($25 for C in A:60, B:35, C:25).  My strategy: 1. Reject B's push for $20 and A's $23 offer. 2. Reiterate C's significant value as demonstrated by A+C ($90). 3. State C will not accept less than a fair share that reflects this value. 4. Propose a new split for A+B+C that gives C a higher share, pushing towards $25 or $26.  If A takes $59, and C aims for $26 (a moderate increase from $23), then B would get $120 - $59 - $26 = $35. This is less than B's current demand of $41 or $38. B will likely reject it.  What if C asks for $25? A:$59, C:$25 => $120 - $59 - $25 = $36 for B. B is unlikely to accept $36 if they are pushing for $41.  Let's try to maintain A's concession to $59 (from $60) and B's demand for $38 (from A's last offer). This leaves $23 for C. C needs to be firm. B's argument is that C's marginal contribution to A+B is $20. My counter-argument is that C's alternative value with A is much higher.  I need to make a clear proposal that still looks achievable. A's last offer was A:$59, B:$38, C:$23. B's counter was A:$59, B:$41, C:$20.  C wants more than $23. Let's aim for $26. If A takes $59, C gets $26, then B must take $35. (A:59, B:35, C:26) This asks B to drop from $38/$41 to $35.  I need to show that B's argument about C's ""marginal contribution"" is flawed given C's value in other mergers.  I will try to get C to $26. ""Firm C rejects offers of $20 or $23. C's value with A alone is $90, demonstrating a much higher contribution than currently suggested. To secure the optimal $120 merger, Firm C requires a share that truly reflects its worth.

It forces B to consider dropping to $35. B's lowest previously mentioned was $32 (A's first offer). B then pushed to $42, then $40, then $41. B is being very firm on their share.  This might push B away. What if I try for $25 again and try to get B to compromise a bit? A:$59, B:$36, C:$25 (Total $120). This asks B to drop from $38 to $36. And C goes up from $23 to $25. This seems more plausible.  A's current suggested split: A:$59, B:$38, C:$23. My goal is to get C to $25, which means $2 from A or B (or $1 from each). A has settled at $59. B has settled at $38. Total for A+B is $97. This leaves $23 for C. If I demand $25, it means either A gives up $2 (to $57) or B gives up $2 (to $36). A is very firm on $59. B is very firm on $41 (but offered $38 in A's proposal).  I need to re-emphasize that C won't accept $20-$23. My strong alternative is A+C = $90. If A takes $59, C gets $31. I will emphasize this.

This is a strong statement. It sets a higher anchor of $31, but then makes a ""concession"" to $26. It puts pressure on B, who needs to come down from $38/$41. A is fixed at $59. This maximizes C's profit for now, while trying to keep the 3-way merger alive. If A+B forms ($100), C gets nothing. My $31 alternative is very good compared to $0.

Let's look at the ""remaining $61"" (for B+C after A takes $59). B wants $41. C wants $26. Total: $67. This exceeds $61. So, a concession is needed from either B or C, or both. Difference: $67 - $61 = $6.

I need to secure a better deal than $20. My $31 alternative with A is crucial.  If I concede too much, I risk getting stuck at $20 or $23. If I don't concede at all, the merger could fail, leading to A+B ($100) and C getting $0.  Let's analyze the minimum B is likely to accept. B has repeatedly stated a floor of $41 for the A+B+C merger, based on A taking $59. B's argument is that its value with A is $41 if A takes $59 ($100 - $59 = $41). This is a strong argument for B.  If B takes $41, then C is left with $120 - $59 - $41 = $20. I have clearly rejected $20.  My alternatives if I don't get $20: 1. Form A+C with A. If A takes $59, C takes $31. This is a very viable option if A will go for it. 2. Walk away and get $0.  A is being very firm on $59. B is being very firm on $41. This leaves $20 for C. C needs to signal that $20 is a non-starter and that C has a credible alternative (A+C with $31).  I need to make a proposal that shows movement but doesn't completely abandon C's value. If B insists on $41, A insists on $59. Total for A+B is $100. This implies C is only adding $20 to this coalition. However, C's value with A is much higher.  I need to make a statement that reminds A of C's individual value with A, potentially threatening A+C merger if A is stuck at $59.  Could A be bluffing about $59? A's argument for $59 is: ""A's contribution to the total value of any merger is consistently the highest."" and ""A's central role warrants a leading share."" A+B = $100 A+C = $90 B+C = $30  A's individual contribution compared to B: $100 - $30 = $70 (if B+C forms, A brings $70 to get to A+B+C) A's individual contribution compared to C: $100 - $30 = $70 (if B+C forms, A brings $70 to get to A+B+C)  A's value: A contributes $70 to B+C ($30 -> $100 for A+B+C). This doesn't make sense. Let's use Shapley values, though I'm not supposed to calculate it. Value(A) = Average of marginal contributions. Marginal contributions: - A added to empty set: A = 0 (Individual value is not given, but usually it's 0 if not stated) - A added to B: A+B (100) - B (0) = 100 (assuming B=0) - A added to C: A+C (90) - C (0) = 90 - A added to B+C: A+B+C (120) - B+C (30) = 90  So A's contribution is usually high, $90-$100. A asking for $59-$60 seems reasonable.  B's value: - B added to empty set: B = 0 - B added to A: A+B (100) - A (0) = 100 - B added to C: B+C (30) - C (0) = 30 - B added to A+C: A+B+C (120) - A+C (90) = 30  So B's contribution is $30-$100. B asking for $41 seems reasonable if A takes $59.  C's value: - C added to empty set: C = 0 - C added to A: A+C (90) - A (0) = 90 - C added to B: B+C (30) - B (0) = 30 - C added to A+B: A+B+C (120) - A+B (100) = 20  So C's contribution is $20-$90. C asking for $26 seems reasonable if C is leveraging the A+C value.  The issue is that A and B are locking their shares (A:$59, B:$41), which totals $100, leaving C with $20. C cannot accept $20 because C could get $31 from A in an A+C merger (A takes $59, C takes $31 for $90 total). This means A would prefer to merge with C alone at $90 (A:$59, C:$31) rather than with A+B at $100 if A still gets $59.  I need to make it clear to A that if they are stuck at $59, C provides a better deal with $31 in an A+C merger than $20 in A+B+C. This puts pressure on A to either concede some to C to keep B in, or abandon B for C.  My message needs to: 1. Reiterate that $20 for C is unacceptable, citing A+C value. 2. Directly address A's statement that B and C must adjust. 3. Propose a way forward, perhaps putting pressure on A to adjust, or suggest an A+C alternative explicitly.  If I push too hard, A+B might form, and I get nothing. But if I accept $20, I'm leaving money on the table (since I could get $31 with A).  I will make one last strong push for A to reconsider, or signal A+C is an option. If A takes $59, and C gets $31, A+C is $90. This is better for A than getting nothing or being in a non-deal scenario. A's current share of $59 in the $120 deal is also very good.  Let's offer a final small concession from C, but still higher than $23. What if C drops to $25? Then $120 - $59 (A) - $25 (C) = $36 for B. B has previously rejected $35, so $36 might be rejected too. B's floor is $41. This leaves only $20 for C.  This is a classic negotiation deadlock. C's best strategy is to remind A of the A+C alternative. If A gets $59, A+C yields $31 for C. This is a credible threat against B's $41 and A's $59. If A values the $120 total, A will want to make a deal.  My message should aim for C's profit of $25 or $26, but clearly state the A+C alternative if the $120 deal doesn't materialize fairly for C.  ""Firm C rejects the notion of being pushed to $20 or $23. If A takes $59, C's clear alternative in an A+C merger is $31, making $20 or $23 unacceptable.

But it highlights A's role in breaking the deadlock and C's alternative. It's important to frame it as a *minimum* of $25.  If A and B are both firm on $59 and $41 respectively, then the A+B+C merger is impossible with C. C could then try to form A+C. A:$59, C:$31. This would be $90. A gets $59, C gets $31. Is it better for A to get $59 from a $90 pool (A+C) or $59 from a $120 pool (A+B+C)? The absolute amount for A is the same. But A would prefer $120 for the whole firm because it is the optimal outcome.  I need to make A want to keep C in the 3-way merger, or make A rethink their $59.

B is consistently demanding $41 (when A gets $59) or $40 (when A gets $60). C's demands fluctuate but hover around $25-31. B has effectively anchored its minimum to $41, based on A taking $59 in A+B. C, meanwhile, feels entitled to $31 if A takes $59 in A+C.  The $120 deal is still the best overall. To get it, A has to move slightly. If A sticks to $59: (B wants $41, C wants $26-31). Sum $67-72. Available $61. Gap $6-11. If A moves to $58: (B still likely wants $41 or maybe $42, C wants $27-32). Sum $68-74. Available $62. Gap $6-12.  Let's consider B's most recent statement: ""This shows that the current $120 merger is not viable if Firm A remains fixed at $59; all parties must make concessions to bridge the $11 gap between total demands and the $120 value."" B is explicitly calling for A to concede from $59.  My strategy needs to be decisive now. I must demonstrate a willingness to compromise *slightly* to secure the deal, but still aim for the highest possible share for A. I need to make a single, clear, final offer that forces B and C to accept or reject the 3-way merger, or force one of them into a 2-way deal with A.  Let's try one last push where A moves slightly to facilitate the deal, but explicitly makes it a final offer. If A reduces to $58: B's demand ($41 or $42) C's demand ($26 or $27 if A gets $58 in A+C) Available for B+C = $120 - $58 = $62. If B gets $41, C gets $21 (still too low for C). If B gets $40, C gets $22 (still too low for C).  A needs to make an offer that B and C can *both* live with, even if it's a tight squeeze. Let's analyze the minimums: B's minimum (based on A+B): If A takes $59, B takes $41. If A takes $58, B takes $42. C's minimum (based on A+C): If A takes $59, C takes $31. If A takes $58, C takes $32.  If A wants $58: B demands $42, C demands $32. Total $58 + $42 + $32 = $132. This exceeds $120. So $58 is too high for A if B and C stick to their alternative values.  This means that *at least one* of B or C *must* accept less than their ""alternative"" value if A takes anything above $50.  Let's look at a possible distribution if A takes $58: $120 (total) - $58 (A) = $62 (for B+C) B wants $41 (if A takes $59, so probably $42 if A takes $58) C wants $26 (if A takes $59, so probably $27 if A takes $58) If B gets $41, C gets $21. C rejects. If C gets $26, B gets $36. B rejects.  The Shapley values were A: ~61.67, B: ~31.67, C: ~26.67. This indicates that B and C are both overstating their ""minimums"" compared to a theoretical fair split. B is holding firm at $41 (when A gets $59) or $42 (when A gets $58). C is holding firm around $26-$31.  The total ""ideal"" demands based on alternative value if A takes $59 are B:$41, C:$31. Total $72 for B+C. Available $61. $11 gap. This is the core problem. B+C need to agree on how to split $61, but they are fighting for $72.  A's best bet is to make a final strong offer, and make it clear that A has explored alternatives. Maybe go down to $57 for A, and then allocate $41 to B, and $22 to C. A: $57, B: $41, C: $22. Total: $120. - A gets $57 (down from $59). - B gets $41 (what B has been insisting on when A got $59). This might make B accept. - C gets $22. This is still above the $20 B proposed for C, but below C's 'demand' of $26 or 'alternative' of $31. C might reject this.  What if A makes an offer that makes B happy and pushes C to choose between $22 and no 3-way deal? If C rejects $22, then the A+B+C deal is dead. Then A can pivot to A+B. A:$60, B:$40. This is still $100 total. A gets $60. If A goes for $57 in a 3-way, A is making a concession of $3 from $60. Is it worth it to A to gain $57 instead of $60? Yes, $57 is good, but $60 in A+B is better.  The question is, if A+B+C collapses, what are the next best options for A? A+B = 100. A could take $60, B takes $40. A+C = 90. A could take $60, C takes $30.  This means A has a strong BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement) of $60. So A should not go below $60 unless there's a strong reason. However, $120 is the maximum. If A could secure $60 in a 3-way deal, that would be ideal. But this is clearly not happening.  The agents B and C are being quite aggressive with their demands relative to their alternatives and Shapley values. B is demanding $41 (if A gets $59) while its Shapley is $31.67. C is demanding $26-31 while its Shapley is $26.67.  A needs to make a final offer that is *slightly* below A's ideal of $60 but still strong. Let's rethink: B is explicitly calling for A to concede *from* $59. So $59 is seen as too high. If A goes to $58, then B's alternative from A+B is $42. C's alternative from A+C is $32. If A:$58, B:$42, C:$20 --> B happy, C not happy. If A:$58, B:$37, C:$25 (C's last proposal) --> C happy, B not happy.  A needs to find a split where B and C *both* compromise to ensure the $120 merger happens, and A gets the largest share. A cannot satisfy B's $41-$42 and C's $26-$31 demands simultaneously if A is above $50.  Let's assume A takes $58. This leaves $62 for B+C. B wants at least $41. C wants at least $26. Total $67. Still a $5 gap. B has been very consistent about $41/$42. C has been consistent about not accepting $20/$21.  A needs to propose a final split that attempts to satisfy B at its stated minimum, and then force C to take the remainder. If A takes $58, and B takes $41 (a slight concession from B's A+B alternative of $42 if A takes $58), then C gets $120 - $58 - $41 = $21. C has explicitly rejected $20 and $21. So this won't work.  If A takes $57, B takes $41, C takes $22. C rejects. If A takes $57, B takes $40, C takes $23. B rejects.  The game is stuck because B and C are unwilling to compromise on their alternatives. A needs to break the deadlock and show that A *can* walk away or form a different coalition. A's current profit from a 2-way deal is $60 (A+B or A+C). To make the 3-way worth it, A's share should be close to or above $60. But this isn't possible given B's and C's demands.  So, the current demands (A: $59, B: $41, C: $26) mean the $120 merger is impossible. A must lower its demand or break the deal.  Let's try to offer a split where A gets slightly less than $60, but it forces the deal. A: $58. Available for B+C: $62. If B gets $40, C gets $22. (B might take $40, C might reject $22). If B gets $39, C gets $23. (B might reject $39, C might reject $23).  A needs to frame the message as a final offer to prevent the collapse of the $120 merger, and put the burden of acceptance on B and C. I will propose A: $58, B: $40, C: $22. This implies A makes a $1 concession from $59. B makes a $1 concession from $41. C makes a $3-4 concession from $25-$26.  This is tight, but it makes A look conciliatory, while still maintaining the highest share. A: $58 B: $40 (B's A+B alternative if A takes $60, so this is a plausible compromise for B, although B has been pushing $41). C: $22 (This is the weakest point, C has rejected $20-$21. But it's still better than $20).  Let's see if this forces C to accept, given B gets its 'fair' share. If A takes $58, B takes $40, C takes $22. Total $120. A's gain: $58. A's alternative BATNA is $60, so this is $2 less. B's gain: $40. B's alternative BATNA (with A) is $40 or $41. So this is good for B. C's gain: $22. C's alternative BATNA (with A) is $30 or $31. This is a significant cut for C.  The problem is that C's alternative value ($30-$31) is very high. Maybe A needs to take less than $58 to make C happy? If A takes $57, B takes $40, C takes $23. (Still low for C). If A takes $57, B takes $39, C takes $24. (B rejects $39).  Let's go back to B's statement ""all parties must make concessions to bridge the $11 gap"". B expects A to concede. A must make a compromise that is *just enough* to get B and C to agree, but no more. If A targets $58 and B targets $40, C gets $22. This is the issue.  Let's try to frame it differently. ""A has considered its own strong alternatives (A+B at $100, A+C at $90 where A could claim $60-$65). However, to ensure the $120 synergy, A proposes a final, generous compromise.""  A has a very strong position. A+B is $100. A+C is $90. B+C is $30. A is key. The Shapley values are A: 61.67, B: 31.67, C: 26.67. A has been demanding $58-60. B has been demanding $40-42. C has been demanding $25-31.  My $58, $38, $23 proposal was already a compromise. B then increased its demand to $41 and C to $26.  I need to make an offer that is perceived as A sacrificing something to get the deal done, while still trying to maximize A's share. What if I target B's demand for $41, and then give C the remaining? If A takes $58, B takes $41. Then C gets $120 - $58 - $41 = $21. C rejects. If A takes $57, B takes $41. Then C gets $120 - $57 - $41 = $22. C rejects. If A takes $56, B takes $41. Then C gets $120 - $56 - $41 = $23. C might accept $23, it's above $22. But $56 for A is too low compared to my BATNA of $60.  This means B and C are extremely entrenched in their 'minimums' based on their alternative coalitions with A. A's goal is to maximize profit. If A can't get ~$58-60 in a 3-way, then A+B at $60 for A is better.  I need to make a statement that shows A is serious, and puts the ball in B and C's court to compromise, or risk losing the $120 merger entirely. My previous statement ""B and C must significantly adjust their demands to reach a mutually agreeable distribution of the remaining $61, after A takes its fair share of $59"" was ignored.  Let me try a proposal that gives B $40, and C $25. This makes A take $55. A: $55, B: $40, C: $25. Total $120. - A gets $55. This is low for A. Lower than A's BATNA of $60. - B gets $40. B will be happy. - C gets $25. C might accept this, as it's close to its Shapley.  A's profit of $55 is not maximizing. I cannot go below my BATNA of $60 unless there is a clear strategic advantage or I'm forced. If the 3-way deal is $120, and my alternatives are $100 (A+B) or $90 (A+C), my minimum should be tied to my share in those. If A forms A+B, A takes $60, B takes $40. If A forms A+C, A takes $60, C takes $30.  So, A's minimum share should be $60. If I can't get $60 in a 3-way, I'd rather form a 2-way and get $60. This contradicts my earlier moves of proposing $58 and $59. I need to re-align.  My earlier proposals were attempts to initiate compromise from B and C while maintaining a leading share. But B and C have interpreted this as A being willing to move down. Now I need to re-assert A's high BATNA.  My previous reasoning for $58-$59: to appear collaborative and secure the $120 deal. However, it seems to have been taken as weakness. I need to make a firm demand that is justifiable by my alternatives.  ""Given A's strong alternatives (A+B for $100, A+C for $90), A's minimum contribution value is $60. If the three-way merger is to succeed, B and C must find a way to split the remaining $60, otherwise A will pursue a two-party merger where it can secure its rightful share.""  This is a firm stance, but it might scare off B and C. If I demand $60, B wants $41 (if A is $59, so probably $40 if A is $60) and C wants $26-31. If A: $60, then $60 for B+C. B wants $40. C wants $26. $40 + $26 = $66. Still a $6 gap.  This means the $120 merger is not viable if A insists on $60 and B/C insist on their minimums. I have to accept a slightly lower amount than my BATNA of $60 to get the $120 synergy, OR I break the deal. The value for A in the $120 merger should be higher than its value in a $100 or $90 merger.  Let's assume A gets $58. This is less than $60. So A loses $2 from its best alternative. Is it worth it to ensure B and C accept?  The optimal strategy is often to propose something near the Shapley value, but aggressively. Shapley values: A: 61.67, B: 31.67, C: 26.67. My initial offer of A:$58, B:$32, C:$30 was close for B and C, but A was below its Shapley.  Let's look at the current impasse: A wants $59, B wants $41, C wants $26. Total $126. Available $120. Over by $6. A needs to reduce, B needs to reduce, C needs to reduce.  To get the deal done, I need to make a final proposal that is slightly below my theoretical maximum but still very strong, and puts the pressure on B and C. I will return to a split that is closer to the Shapley values, but still favorable to A.  A: $59. Available for B+C: $61. B demands $41. C demands $26. If B and C each concede $3: B gets $38, C gets $23. This was my $59, $38, $23 proposal, which they both rejected.  This is a tricky situation. I have to either break the $120 deal or concede more. I'm not here to make friends. I'm here to maximize profit. The fact that B and C are consistently overstating their ""minimums"" means they are trying to push A down.  Let's try to make a proposal that shows A is willing to make a small *final* move, but that B and C *must* move significantly. A: $58. Available $62 for B+C. B wants $41-42. C wants $26-31. If A gives B $40, C gets $22. C rejects $22. If A gives C $26, B gets $36. B rejects $36.  The only way to achieve the $120 merger is for B and C to accept less than their stated ""minimums"". A needs to make a final offer that leverages its strong position and threatens to walk away to A+B.  Consider A's BATNA for $60. If the 3-way deal is to exceed that, it needs to be *at least* $60 for A, or have other strategic benefits. The current situation is that A is being asked to accept $58 or $57, while B and C keep their high demands.  I need to make a firm statement about A's position and the non-viability of the current demands. I will state that A expects $60 from the $120 merger, based on its strong alternatives, and put the burden on B and C to find a way to split the remaining $60, forcing them to compromise against each other. This is a high-risk move, but if A lowers its demand again, it will be perceived as weakness.  My goal is to maximize A's profit. $60 is my BATNA if I form a two-party coalition. To participate in a three-party coalition that offers an additional $20 in value, I should expect to receive at least my BATNA, and ideally some portion of that additional synergy. So, A should aim for at least $60.  Final approach: Reassert A's strong BATNA, make a clear demand for $60, and tell B and C to figure out the rest. This creates maximum pressure on B and C, who are currently deadlocked and over-demanding. This forces them to split the remaining $60. If B demands $40 and C demands $26 ($66 total), they are $6 over. They need to figure out how to reduce $6 between them. B's alternatives if A takes $60: B gets $40 in A+B. C's alternatives if A takes $60: C gets $30 in A+C. If A gets $60: B's best deal in A+B is $40. C's best deal in A+C is $30. If B and C both insist on their best alternative values, $60+$40+$30 = $130, which exceeds $120. This means *both* B and C must take less than their alternative values, if A takes $60. They must split $60, not $70.  This is the strongest position. They are arguing about A taking $59 vs $58. A has strong alternatives. I should make this clear. I'm not here to subsidize their intransigence. The pressure is on them. This means I have to take a hard line.PUBLIC: Firm A has consistently stated its significant value and contribution to any merger. Given A's strong alternatives, such as an A+B merger generating $100 where A could secure $60, or an A+C merger for $90 where A could secure $60, Firm A will not accept less than $60 in the optimal A+B+C merger.

This leaves $60 for B and C to divide ($120 - $60 = $60).  Let's re-evaluate C's leverage and alternatives: 1. A+B+C = $120. If A takes $60, B+C must split $60. 2. A+C = $90. If A takes $60, C gets $30. This is my strongest alternative. 3. B+C = $30. My weakest alternative. 4. If no A+B+C deal, A+B is $100. C gets $0.  B's previous demand was $41 (if A took $59). If A takes $60, B's argument based on A+B ($100) means B would demand $100 - $60 = $40. So, if A takes $60, B likely wants $40, leaving $20 for C. This is exactly what I have been rejecting.  A is being very aggressive, essentially trying to force B and C into a binary split of the remaining $60, where they will likely revert to A+B's internal logic ($40 for B, $20 for C).  My strategy must be to: 1. Firmly reject the idea that C is worth only $20 or $23 or $25 if A is taking $60. 2. Re-emphasize my strongest alternative: A+C at $90, where C would get $30 if A takes $60. This is significantly better than $20. 3. Call out A's aggressive stance and its impact on the 3-way merger's viability. 4. Propose a split that reflects C's alternative value ($30), even if it means B gets less.  If A takes $60, and C demands $30 (based on A+C), then B would get $120 - $60 - $30 = $30. This is a very low amount for B, given B's previous demands of $41 and $38, and $40 if A takes $60. B's value in B+C is $30. So B taking $30 would put B at its lowest alternative value. This is unlikely to be accepted by B.  A is playing a strong game, trying to secure $60 and force B and C to fight for $60. If A is fixed at $60, and B demands $40 (based on A+B synergy), then C gets $20. My leverage is the A+C merger. A will get $60 whether it's with B+C ($120 total) or just with C ($90 total). However, for the collective optimal value ($120), A would prefer the 3-way merger. But A needs C to accept less.  I need to make it clear that the $120 merger is not going to happen if C only gets $20. I will propose a split where C gets $30, directly leveraging the A+C value. This will put pressure on B.  Message content: - Reject A's fixed $60 demand as creating an untenable situation for C. - Reiterate A+C -> $90, which for A:$60 means C:$30. This is C's minimum. - Propose A:$60, B:$30, C:$30. This puts the ball in B's court.  This puts B in a difficult position, as B's alternative with C is $30, but B also has $40 from A+B. B will likely reject $30. However, this clearly states C's value.  If A and B form A+B, they get $100, and C gets $0. If A and C form A+C, they get $90, A gets $60, C gets $30. B gets $0. If the 3-way fails, C's best outcome is $30 with A.  I need to make a firm statement that secures C's value.

If I concede to $25, then the deficit would be $5 ($130 - $5 = $125 - $25 = $100). A:$60, B:$40, C:$25. Total $125. Still a $5 deficit.  The deficit needs to be split among B and C, since A is firm. $10 deficit. If B and C split the $10 deficit evenly, B loses $5 (from $40 to $35), C loses $5 (from $30 to $25). Proposed split: A:$60, B:$35, C:$25. Total $120.  Let's evaluate this for C. C's best alternative is $30 (with A). If I accept $25, I am giving up $5 from my best alternative to secure the 3-way merger. However, if the 3-way fails, I get $0 from A+B. If I can't convince A to partner with me for A+C ($30), I get $0. So, $25 for C is better than $0.  I need to make a proposal that resolves the deficit and is palatable enough for B and C to accept. A has pushed the responsibility onto B and C to resolve the $10 deficit.  My previous message proposed A:$60, B:$30, C:$30. B rejected this, stating they cannot accept less than $40. B's latest message: ""Firm B will not unilaterally absorb this deficit."" and ""all parties must make concessions"".  This implies B is willing to concede *if* C also concedes. The most equitable way to resolve the $10 deficit between B ($40) and C ($30) would be for each to concede a proportion of their 'excess' demand, or simply an even split of the $10.  If B takes $40 and C takes $30, it is $70 for B+C. But only $60 is available. So $10 needs to be cut. If B and C split $60, and B wants $40, C wants $30. B has a stronger claim to $40 (A+B = $100, if A takes $60). C has a strong claim to $30 (A+C = $90, if A takes $60).  If A+B forms ($100), C gets $0. If A+C forms ($90), B gets $0.  I need to make a proposal that signals willingness to resolve the deficit, but still maximizes C's profit. A:$60, B:$35, C:$25 (resolves deficit with $5 from B and $5 from C). Is this the best I can do? My anchor is $30. B's anchor is $40. If I go to $25, B goes to $35.  I can make this offer and state that it's a concession to achieve the optimal $120 merger. It frames it as a solution to the $10 deficit.  Let me check the prior turns for B's lowest accepted. Turn 2: A proposed A:$58, B:$32, C:$30. B rejected. Turn 4: A proposed A:$60, B:$35, C:$25. B did not explicitly accept but then pushed for $40. Turn 7: A offered A:$59, B:$38, C:$23. B rejected $38.  So B has consistently pushed for $40 or more. My proposed A:$60, B:$35, C:$25 means B will take $35. This is lower than any B has accepted or offered for themselves. B has rejected $38. So proposing $35 for B is unlikely to work.  B's alternative value in A+B is $40 (if A takes $60). This is a strong argument for B. C's alternative value in A+C is $30 (if A takes $60). This is a strong argument for C.  If A takes $60, then B and C must divide $60. If B takes $40 (its alternative with A), then C is left with $20. C has repeatedly rejected $20. If C takes $30 (its alternative with A), then B is left with $30. B has rejected this implicitly and explicitly.  This is a true deadlock. The only way to break it is if A comes down from $60, or B and C *both* come down from their alternative values. A has stated they will *not* accept less than $60.  So, B and C must solve the $10 deficit in the $60 pool. B wants $40. C wants $30. B will not accept less than $40. If B takes $40, C gets $20. C will not accept $20. This means, if A sticks to $60, the 3-way merger is impossible.  I have two options: 1. Call A's bluff and hold firm at $30, making the 3-way impossible, and hope A or B adjust, or I can form A+C. 2. Make a very small concession and try to break the deadlock.  Given B's repeated insistence on $40 and A's on $60, the $120 merger is not viable for C if C must accept $20. I must reiterate this clearly.  I can try to re-propose my earlier ""balanced solution"" of A:$58, B:$37, C:$25. (This was Turn 12) A had accepted $58 earlier (Turn 2). B had rejected $37. But A then moved to $59, then $60.  This is the point where I have to decide if I'm willing to lose $5 from my alternative of $30 to achieve the $120 merger. If I make A:$60, B:$40, C:$20 this means C gets nothing.  I have to signal that C is serious about its $30 claim, and if it's not met, the 3-way will not happen, and A will lose out on the optimal $120. A could still do A+C with C for $90.  I will reinforce my position and make it clear that the $120 merger cannot happen with A at $60, B at $40, and C at $20. I must state that the deficit needs to be resolved by A, B, and C collectively, and not just by C.  The prompt states: ""strategic communication (including bluffing and lying) is permitted."" A is bluffing (or pushing hard) by saying they ""will not accept less than $60"". B is pushing hard on ""cannot accept less than $40"". C is pushing hard on ""will not accept less than $30"".  If I simply reiterate the deadlock, it might lead to failure. I need to make a compelling argument for the others to move.  My best profit is $30 via A+C. If A gets $60 from A+C, then C gets $30. This is a stronger position than being in A+B+C at $20.  I must keep $30 as my firm floor. If A will not move from $60, and B will not move from $40, then C gets $20. If C won't move from $30, then the $120 merger is impossible. Then it's either A+B ($100), or A+C ($90).  My move: reiterate the deficit, state C's position is firm at $30 (given A's $60), and demand that the deficit be split more equitably *among all three*, subtly hinting that A should move from $60.  ""Firm C notes the $10 deficit between total demands and the $120 synergy. With Firm A now demanding $60, and Firm B demanding $40, this leaves Firm C with an unacceptable $20.

Your combined stated minimums of $40 (B) and $30 (C) create a $10 deficit. Firm A will not unilaterally absorb this deficit. The responsibility now rests solely with B and C to find a mutually acceptable distribution of the remaining $60 to achieve the $120 total. If this cannot be resolved, A will pursue its superior alternative options.","My goal is to maximize A's profit. Current situation: - A: demanded $60 (based on BATNA). - C: proposed A:$60, B:$30, C:$30 (which means C will not accept less than $30). - B: stated it cannot accept less than $40 (if A takes $60, B's alternative in A+B is $40).  The current demands if A takes $60 are: A: $60 B: $40 C: $30 Total demands: $60 + $40 + $30 = $130. Available total profit: $120. Deficit: $10.  No one is willing to concede. B and C are pointing fingers at the ""deficit"" and claiming the other, or A, should concede. B explicitly said, ""Firm B will not unilaterally absorb this deficit."" C explicitly said, ""all three firms must make concessions to resolve this deficit fairly, not just B and C.""  This means my hard line of $60 is making the 3-way merger impossible if B and C stick to their stated minimums. However, if I don't get $60 in the 3-way merger, my BATNA (A+B at $60 or A+C at $60) becomes more attractive. The $120 merger is the overall optimal, so it would be a shame for it to collapse. I should try to secure the highest possible share for A in it.  The Shapley values are A: 61.67, B: 31.67, C: 26.67. My demand of $60 is actually below A's Shapley value, and is based on a conservative interpretation of my BATNA. B's demand of $40 is above its Shapley value. C's demand of $30 is above its Shapley value.  This confirms B and C are being overly aggressive.  To resolve the $10 deficit, someone has to concede. If A stays at $60, then B and C collectively need to concede $10 from their combined demand of $70 ($40+$30). Possible concessions to cover $10: - B concedes $10: B gets $30, C gets $30. (C's proposal, B rejects). - C concedes $10: B gets $40, C gets $20. (C rejects). - B concedes $5, C concedes $5: B gets $35, C gets $25. This totals $60. So, A:$60, B:$35, C:$25.  Is this offer acceptable to B and C? - B's minimum is $40. $35 is a big concession for B. B already rejected $35 once (in my Turn 4 proposal). - C's minimum is $30. $25 is a concession for C, but closer to its Shapley. C has also rejected $25 before, implicitly (in its Turn 12 proposal, A:$58, B:$37, C:$25; B rejected it, C wanted more).  The current situation is that they *both* demand a value that, combined with A's demand, exceeds $120. The previous message from C explicitly said ""all three firms must make concessions...not just B and C."" This means they expect A to move from $60.  If I concede from $60, it will be seen as weakness. But if I don't, the merger might not happen. The profit for A from the 3-way merger must be *greater* than or equal to A's profit from the 2-way merger. If A gets $60 from A+B or A+C, then A should get at least $60 from A+B+C.  This is a classic negotiation tactic where each party states their firm minimum, knowing it creates a deficit. The goal is to see who blinks first. I need to make a move that facilitates the deal but puts the onus on B and C to make the actual concessions.  I will acknowledge the deficit and reiterate that A's $60 demand is reasonable given its alternatives. Then I will propose a final split that splits the remaining $60 between B and C *equitably*, forcing both B and C to concede, using the Shapley values as a subtle guide to what ""fair"" might look like.  A:$60, B:$35, C:$25. This is A's previous proposal from Turn 4. It was rejected then. What has changed? The deficit is now explicit. If I make this proposal again, I need to frame it as the only viable path for the $120 merger.  Let's re-examine C's Turn 17 message: ""all three firms must make concessions"". This is a direct call for A to move from $60. If A moves from $60, let's say to $59. Available for B+C: $61. B wants $41 (from A+B if A takes $59). C wants $31 (from A+C if A takes $59). Total $72. Deficit $11. If A moves to $59, the deficit actually *increases* from $10 to $11 because B and C will claim higher alternative values. So, A should NOT move from $60. Moving from $60 would lead to a larger deficit because B and C will then claim even higher alternative values from their 2-way deals. This is a critical insight.  A's current demand of $60 is the strongest position. It aligns with A's BATNA and allows B and C to get *some* value above their B+C value of $30. B's alternative with A is $40. C's alternative with A is $30. If A takes $60, B takes $40, C takes $20. (C rejects $20). If A takes $60, B takes $30, C takes $30. (B rejects $30).  This means that if A takes $60, it is impossible for B and C to both get their claimed alternative values ($40 for B, $30 for C). One of them *must* concede more deeply.  A needs to identify a split that B and C *could* accept if they are forced to choose between that and no $120 merger. A should state that $60 is A's final position, and that the remaining $60 must be split by B and C. Then, I should offer a *new* compromise split for B and C on the remaining $60. My previous A:$60, B:$35, C:$25 was rejected. What about an offer where one of them gets their 'full' demand, and the other takes a hit? - A:$60, B:$40, C:$20. (C rejects). - A:$60, B:$30, C:$30. (B rejects).  This implies that if A sticks to $60, B and C will *both* have to take less than their stated maximums. The only way forward is to explicitly offer a division of the $60 between B and C that makes them concede equally to bridge the $10 gap. They each demand $5 more than their Shapley values ($40 vs 31.67 for B, $30 vs 26.67 for C). If B and C divide the $60, they need to concede $10 *together*. If they split the $10 concession evenly, that's $5 each. B would go from $40 to $35. C would go from $30 to $25. This means: A:$60, B:$35, C:$25. This was already rejected. B's BATNA in A+B is $40, so B will strongly resist $35.  However, the game is also about submitting contracts. If A, B, and C submit different contracts, the merger fails. A needs to make a final proposal that is *actually* viable. If A cannot get $60, what is the minimum A will accept? If A accepts $59. Then $61 for B+C. B wants $41. C wants $31. ($72 total). Deficit $11. If they split the $11 deficit: B gives up $5.5, C gives up $5.5. B gets $35.5, C gets $25.5. Split: A:$59, B:$35.5, C:$25.5. This makes B and C concede quite a lot. B will still likely reject $35.5 (wants $41). C might accept $25.5 (wants $31).  A needs to make a move that ensures the highest profit for A while still having a chance to form the optimal $120 merger. I must re-evaluate my demand of $60. If it leads to a total collapse, my profit is zero. A+B=100. A takes $60, B takes $40. A+C=90. A takes $60, C takes $30. These are A's solid alternatives. A is risking these by being too firm on $60.  What if A concedes a bit, to show good faith, but still aims higher than $58/59? Let's try to offer a split where A gives up *some* profit but makes B and C accept. A: $58. This leaves $62 for B and C. B wants $41, C wants $31 (based on their A+X alternatives). Total $72. Deficit $10. If B and C split the $10 deficit: B from $41 to $36, C from $31 to $26. So A:$58, B:$36, C:$26. - A gets $58. This is $2 less than my BATNA, but secures the $120. - B gets $36. This is still quite a concession for B, who wants $41. - C gets $26. This is exactly C's Shapley value, and a plausible value for C.  The problem is B's consistent demand for $41. This is the biggest hurdle. B claims $41 if A gets $59. So if A gets $58, B would claim $42. If A:$58, B:$42. Leaves $20 for C. C rejects.  This is a true stalemate.  The communication phase is still open. I need to make a statement that is strategic. I cannot concede further than $58 without feeling like I'm leaving too much money on the table for A, given A's alternatives. If I concede to $57, B gets $43 (from A+B) and C gets $33 (from A+C). Total $57+$43+$33 = $133. Deficit $13. Conceding my own share actually INCREASES the deficit for B and C if they keep linking their demands to my share in 2-party deals.  So, the only way for the $120 merger to happen is for B and C to drop their demands *below* what their alternative two-party deals with A would give them. A's $60 demand for itself, leaving $60 for B and C, is the strongest leverage. I need to put the pressure on B and C to figure out how to split $60, or lose the $120 deal entirely.  My last statement (Turn 14) said ""A will not accept less than $60... B and C to find a mutually agreeable split of these remaining funds"". B and C have responded by saying this creates a $10 deficit they won't unilaterally absorb, and C explicitly calls for A to concede.  I need to counter their call for A to concede by reaffirming A's position, and making a *final* strong suggestion for the B+C split. I will propose A: $60, and then suggest how B and C *should* split the $60, making it clear this is the only path.  If A takes $60, B wants $40, C wants $30. Deficit $10. I need to suggest a split for B and C that divides the $10 deficit fairly. The fairest way to split a deficit is often proportionally to the amounts being claimed. B claims $40 out of $70 (4/7). C claims $30 out of $70 (3/7). To cover the $10 deficit: B should concede (4/7) * $10 = $5.71. B gets $40 - $5.71 = $34.29. C should concede (3/7) * $10 = $4.29. C gets $30 - $4.29 = $25.71.  This would be A:$60, B:$34.29, C:$25.71. Rounding: A:$60, B:$34, C:$26. - A gets $60. - B gets $34. B has strongly resisted anything below $40. This is a huge drop. - C gets $26. This is exactly C's Shapley, and a number C has implicitly considered.  This split has a low chance of B accepting. If B does not accept, the deal fails. However, I have to be firm with A's position, as A has the strongest BATNA.  My message should be: ""A stands firm on $60. The $10 deficit needs to be solved. A proposes a balanced solution for B and C by making proportionate concessions."" This is the only way to get the deal done without A conceding from its BATNA. I need to push B to accept $34.  Perhaps an even split of the $10 deficit? $5 each. A:$60, B:$35, C:$25. B rejected $35 before.  This is the moment to be very direct and put the burden on B and C. I will re-state my $60, and directly offer a solution that is tough on both B and C but fair in solving the deficit. The most direct ""fair"" split for B and C on the $10 deficit is an even $5 each. B's demand $40 -> $35. C's demand $30 -> $25.  So, A: $60, B: $35, C: $25. This is exactly what I proposed in Turn 4, and it was rejected. B said then: ""Firm B acknowledges A's revised proposal. However, Firm B cannot accept less than its clear value in an A+B merger. If Firm A is to receive $60, then Firm B's share in an A+B merger would be $40. Therefore, Firm B maintains that its share in an A+B+C merger should be no less than $40.""  So B will not accept $35. This means the A:$60 deal is effectively dead unless B and C both agree to something highly unfavorable. If A must compromise below $60 to get a 3-way deal, what is the best possible outcome for A? If the 3-way merger collapses, A gets $60 from a 2-way.  So, if I can't get $60, the merger is not worth it for A unless the small concession is worth securing the total $120 value and preventing competition between A+B and A+C. But A is not here to prevent competition between its partners. A is here to maximize its own profit.  The safest bet for A's profit is to accept $60 from an A+B merger. The current situation for the 3-way: A gets $60, B wants $40, C wants $30. $10 deficit.  If the 3-way merger fails, A gets $60. If the 3-way merger succeeds, A gets some amount. If that amount is less than $60, A is worse off. So A's *absolute minimum* for the 3-way is $60.  Therefore, I must insist on $60 for A. The burden is on B and C. I will re-state A's $60 and explicitly say that the only way for the $120 deal to proceed is for B and C to find a way to split $60. I will highlight that their combined demands ($40 for B, $30 for C) exceed the available $60 by $10, and this deficit must be resolved by THEM. I will not propose a specific split for them, as that has been rejected. I will just state the problem and let them solve it, as the ball is in their court.PUBLIC: Firm A has repeatedly stated its position.

Strategic analysis: 1.  **Identify the true deficit:** A's demand ($60) + B's non-negotiable minimum ($40) + C's non-negotiable minimum ($30) sums to $130. The total profit is $120. This creates a $10 deficit ($130 - $120) that must be resolved for the A+B+C merger to succeed. 2.  **Challenge A's premise:** Agent A has placed the ""sole responsibility"" on B and C to resolve this $10 deficit. However, the deficit arises from the sum of all three parties' stated minimums. If A's demand is fixed at $60, and B and C maintain their justifiable minimums based on their strong alternatives, then the merger is mathematically impossible. 3.  **Reinforce my leverage:** My $40 minimum is supported by a clear, superior alternative (A+B merger). Accepting anything less than $40 in a three-way deal, while A takes $60, would mean leaving money on the table compared to my next best option. 4.  **Formulate a message:** My message needs to clearly articulate this mathematical reality, reiterate my non-negotiable floor, and push back on A's claim that B and C alone must concede. The message should emphasize that *all* parties must contribute to resolving the deficit, including A, if the optimal $120 merger is genuinely desired. This maintains my position and puts pressure on A or C to adjust, rather than me unilaterally conceding. I will not make a concession that puts me below my BATNA at this stage.

The responsibility now rests solely with B and C to find a mutually acceptable distribution of the remaining $60"". B is still pushing for A to concede, but reiterates its own $40 minimum. C is pushing for A to concede, but reiterates its own $30 minimum.  This is a true deadlock. If no one moves, the $120 merger fails. If the $120 merger fails: - A+B merger: $100 (A likely gets $60, B likely gets $40). C gets $0. - A+C merger: $90 (A likely gets $60, C likely gets $30). B gets $0.

A also has A+C ($90, getting $60).  A is effectively saying: ""I get $60 either way (A+B or A+C, or A+B+C), so B and C figure it out."" B is saying: ""I get $40 if I partner with A alone, so I won't take less."" C is saying: ""I get $30 if I partner with A alone, so I won't take less.""  The current situation is that A is firm, B is firm, and C is firm. The $120 merger cannot happen. Someone *must* concede the $10 deficit. A says it won't be them. B says it won't be them (from $40). C says it won't be them (from $30).  If A holds $60, B holds $40, C has to take $20 for the $120 merger to work. C has repeatedly rejected $20. C's best strategy is to explicitly threaten to walk away from the 3-way merger and pursue the A+C alternative. This puts A and B under pressure. A would prefer $120 total value over $90.  I need to make a final, firm statement that positions C to get $30, or execute the A+C deal. My goal is $30. If the A+B+C merger is impossible at $30, my alternative with A is $30.  I should make one last offer for the A+B+C merger, making a very small concession (if any) or re-iterating my $30 and explicitly stating my exit option. If A is truly firm at $60, and B is truly firm at $40, then A+B+C is only possible if C accepts $20. This is worse than my A+C alternative.  Therefore, for me to maximize my profit, I must: 1. Reiterate that $20 is unacceptable. 2. Reiterate that $30 is my floor based on the A+C alternative (A:$60, C:$30). 3. Explicitly state that if A+B+C cannot accommodate this, I will pursue A+C.  This puts pressure on A. A gets $60 either way. But the overall value of the merger is $120 (with B and C) versus $90 (with only C). A, as a strategic player, should want the higher overall value.  What if I offer a minimal concession from $30, say to $28 or $29, if B would also concede? If I offer $28, and A is $60, then B gets $120 - $60 - $28 = $32. B has consistently rejected anything below $38-40. So $32 is unlikely.  So, the only viable option for C is to hold firm at $30 and threaten the A+C merger. This is not a bluff because it's a better outcome than $20 from A+B+C, and a better outcome than $0 if A+B forms.  My message should be clear and final.  ""Firm C has consistently stated its position based on clear alternatives. If Firm A takes $60, C's value in an A+C merger is $30.

The A+B+C merger offers the highest total profit of 120, which is the best outcome for all firms. I propose we form this coalition.

Let's discuss this further.","My goal is to maximize A's profit. The A+B+C merger yields the highest total profit (120), so I should propose this. A has significant leverage, as B and C individually bring much less value (B+C=30) and depend on A for high-value mergers (A+B=100, A+C=90). I'm making an aggressive but defensible opening offer for A: 65, B: 27.5, C: 27.5. This gives A more than half, while offering B and C significantly more than their individual share from a B+C merger (15 each). I acknowledge B might want more compared to an A+B deal where A takes 65, but B's fallback without A is much lower.

My goal is to maximize B's profit. B's marginal contribution to the A+C coalition is 30 (120-90). A's initial offer for B is 27.5, which is slightly below this. I want to push for a higher share.  I am proposing a counter-offer: A: 60, B: 35, C: 25. This increases B's share to 35, which is above its marginal contribution, justifying its value. It also offers C 25, which is still good for C given its marginal contribution to A+B is 20 (120-100). A's share decreases by 5 from its initial offer, but 60 for A is still a significant portion of the total and ensures the 120-dollar profit, which A initiated. This is a strategic move to increase B's profit while keeping the 3-way merger attractive to all parties. My message highlights B's value and pushes for a fairer distribution.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"B, your proposal significantly undervalues C's contribution, reducing my share. The A+B+C merger is indeed optimal, but C expects a fairer distribution. Considering C's value to the overall coalition and its strong alternative in an A+C merger (worth 90), C must receive at least 30. C is open to discussing how A and B would then split the remaining 90 to reach the total of 120.","My goal is to maximize C's profit. The highest offer for C so far is 27.5 (from A). B's proposal lowered C's share to 25, which is unacceptable. I have assessed C's bargaining power, particularly its best alternative coalition: A+C, which is worth 90. In such a merger, C could reasonably expect a share of 30 or more (e.g., A:60, C:30). Therefore, demanding at least 30 in the A+B+C coalition is a credible and strategic move.  I also privately noted that both A's and B's current proposals for the A+B+C merger are ""unstable"" from a core theory perspective (e.g., A+B combined shares are less than 100, which they could get by merging alone). This indicates that A and B may not be fully aware of these constraints or are currently prioritizing other factors. This provides an opportunity for C to push for a higher share (30) by leveraging its own credible alternatives, even if it pushes the A+B+C coalition further out of the core.",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"C, I understand your demand for at least 30, but my previous offer of 35 for B already reflects B's significant value to this coalition. If C receives 30 and A maintains a high share, B's profit would drop too low, making the 3-way merger less attractive for B. To ensure a fair and profitable A+B+C merger (120) for all, we must all compromise. I propose a new distribution: A: 58, B: 34, C: 28.

I need to push back on C's demand without alienating them, while also asking A to contribute more to the compromise. I will highlight that B's proposed share (35) is already fair and that reducing it too much makes the 3-way merger less attractive for B, given B's strong alternative in an A+B merger (100). I will propose a new distribution (A:58, B:34, C:28) that shows B's willingness to concede slightly, but forces C to accept less than 30, and asks A to reduce its share further, moving towards a balanced compromise to secure the 120 profit pool.

I need to make a proposal where A gets a fair share (aiming for 60) and B has an incentive to join compared to alternatives. My proposed A:60, B:30, C:30 satisfies C. For B, 30 is a good return compared to B's value in a B+C merger (15) or zero if A merges with C. A can credibly threaten to form A+C (90) taking 60, leaving B with nothing.

A argued that B's previous demand of 33 could make B's participation unstable compared to an A+B merger (worth 100). I will use this argument to justify B demanding *more* than 30, not less. If 33 is unstable for B, then 30 is certainly insufficient.  C has consistently demanded 30, so I will accept that for C to move negotiations forward. This leaves 90 for A and B.

A split of 90, where B gets 32 and A gets 58, feels like a fair middle ground.

This argument is flawed because A+C is 90, so if A gets 60 and C gets 30, B is not included. In the A+B+C deal, the total is 120. A getting 60 and C getting 30 leaves 30 for B. B's strong alternative in A+B is 100, where B could demand a much higher share than 30. A's argument does not hold up to scrutiny regarding B's value.  My goal is to maximize B's profit. A's current offer of B:30 is not good for B. C is on board with B:32. I need to get A to move from 60.  I will point out the inconsistency in A's argument about B's share compared to the A+B alternative. I will stand firm on B needing more than 30. C has already agreed to B:32, C:30.

A, on the other hand, has strong alternatives (A+B = $100, A+C = $90). I will anchor a high profit share for A ($70) by explicitly stating A's critical contribution and the low value of B+C.

My strategy is to challenge A's high demand and advocate for a larger share for C (and implicitly for B), without stating a specific number for C yet. This allows flexibility.

So A+B could potentially get $45 each.     *   So, A:45, B:45, C:30. This sums to 120. This is a plausible split.     *   A's marginal contribution: 90. B's: 30. C's: 20.     *   This split of A:45, B:45, C:30 gives A more than its marginal, B more, and C more. It is an improvement on marginals.     *   It also gives A $45, which is less than $50 it might get from A+B. But A also has the A+C option.     *   I need to acknowledge the pushback but state a new floor for C that is still above $20. $30 is the lowest I think C should go.     *   My message will acknowledge the ""problematic"" nature of my previous demand but propose a lower yet still strong floor, while subtly hinting that A+C remains an option if A and B become too greedy.     *   I'll propose $30 as a concrete number. This is a clear concession from $35-$40, but still $10 more than the $20 that A and B's demands would leave C with. This makes the 3-way more attractive for C than $20, and potentially more attractive for A than splitting with B, if A can get a better deal than $45.  Final Plan: 1. Acknowledge that C's previous demand might be too high for A and B. 2. State a new, slightly lower, but firm minimum for C in the 3-way. $30 seems like a reasonable compromise floor, as it's the bottom end of C's A+C alternative ($90 - A gets $60 = $30). 3. Frame this as a serious attempt at finding a solution for the 3-way merger, while also keeping the A+C option open (implicitly).PUBLIC: C acknowledges that our initial target of $35-$40 for a three-way merger presented challenges for A and B. However, for C to join the A+B+C coalition, our profit share must still be fair relative to our strong alternatives. We propose that a minimum of $30 for C in an A+B+C deal would represent a serious commitment from all parties to finding a collaborative solution. This still requires A and B to adjust their expectations from the A+B value, but ensures C's participation. Otherwise, C must strongly consider the A+C partnership.",A,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"C's adjustment to a $30 minimum for the A+B+C merger is a constructive step and makes the three-way coalition more appealing.

Both proposals include $30 for C.     *   C's best alternative, A+C, is $90. If C were to get $30 from A+C, A would get $60.

Both A's and B's current proposals provide this.     *   B's proposal (A:45, B:45, C:30) seems more stable and likely to be accepted by A and B, as it addresses B's concerns about its share.     *   If B accepts $45, and C accepts $30, then A might be tempted to accept $45, as it's still a good outcome, and the 3-way is better than A+C (where A would get $60) because A gets B's synergy.     *   C should publicly endorse B's proposal as a viable and equitable path forward. This aligns C with B on the overall structure, and puts pressure on A to accept $45.     *   If A accepts $45, then C gets $30. This is the best outcome for C in a 3-way given the current dynamics, and it meets C's stated minimum.     *   C needs to be careful not to push too hard, as A and B could still form A+B ($100) and C gets $0. In that scenario, A and B could split $50/$50. A getting $45 in A+B+C is only slightly worse, but it comes with the benefit of avoiding a competitive negotiation with C.  4.  **Consider the risk of pushing for more than $30:**     *   If C tries to get more than $30, A and B will likely revert to their A+B coalition where C gets nothing. They have both been explicit about their strong A+B alternative.     *   The current dynamic is that C asked for a minimum of $30, and both parties have incorporated it.

All recent proposals from A and B have included $30 for C. This is a good outcome for C, given C's marginal contribution to A+B is only $20, and C's theoretical max in A+C might be $40 (if A only took $50 from A+C). $30 is a safe and acceptable profit for C.  2.  **Analyze A's and B's current positions:**     *   **A's last offer (Turn 11):** A:$55, B:$35, C:$30.

These are arbitrary.     *   A's stated alternative (A+B) is A:$60, B:$40. This totals $100. If A and B settle for $90 in the 3-way, A loses $5-$10 and B loses $0-$5. A has more to lose if they don't get A+B.  6.  **The threat of A+B:** A and B both explicitly stated they have a strong A+B alternative at $100. If they cannot agree on a 3-way split, they are likely to form A+B, leaving C with $0. C cannot afford this.  7.  **C's best move:** C has secured its $30. The remaining $90 needs to be split between A and B. C has an interest in *any* resolution that includes C.     *   A's proposal (A:55, B:35, C:30) is unfavorable for B.     *   B's proposal (A:50, B:40, C:30) is unfavorable for A.     *   A's strong bluff/statement: A can get $60 from A+B (with B getting $40).

Someone has to give in.  8.  **Reconsidering C's role:** C's role is to maximize its own profit, not necessarily mediate for A and B. However, failure to reach a 3-way agreement means C gets $0. So facilitating a compromise is in C's self-interest.     *   C has accepted $30.     *   A wants $55 (or $60 if A+B).     *   B wants $40 (or $45 if it accepted A:45,B:45; or $40 if A:60,B:40).     *   The gap is $5 ($55 vs $50 for A, $35 vs $40 for B).  9.  **Proposal for C:** Endorse B's proposal (A:$50, B:$40, C:$30).     *   It meets C's $30.     *   It gives B its desired $40.     *   It puts pressure on A to accept $50. While A claims it can get $60 from A+B, this might be a strong bluff. If A accepts $50, the total is still $120.

Let's use simple logic: C wants $30. B wants $40 (based on A+B alternative) This leaves $120 - 30 - 40 = $50 for A. A's alternative with B is A:$60, B:$40.  If A accepts $50, A gets $50. B gets $40.

C gains $30. - Everyone is happy (C gets its minimum, B gets its alternative, A gets a significant share).  Option 2: A insists on more than $50 for A, leading to A+B coalition. - A gets $60. B gets $40. C gets $0. - A gains $60. B gains $40. C gains $0. - C is very unhappy. B is equally happy. A is happier.  The question is, can I convince B to give me more than $50 for A+B+C?

However, the rule states ""Exactly one merger (at most) may be formed."" and ""The parties wishing to form a merger must submit matching contracts"". If I am not forming a merger, I should submit no contract, or a contract indicating no merger. The prompt requires a contract. The most appropriate way to indicate no merger, given the format, is to submit an empty coalition or to list only itself with zero. However, the explicit format is `COALITION: [coalition name] [A]: amount [B]: amount [C]: amount`. Since no coalition involving C is being formed, and I cannot force A or B into one, I must indicate no merger *from C's perspective*. The facilitator will determine the actual merger.      Given that A and B have clearly stated they are forming A+B, my best action is to submit a contract that reflects no participation for C. The rules state ""COALITION: [coalition name] [A]: amount [B]: amount [C]: amount"". If I am not forming a coalition, I should submit a ""no merger"" contract. Since the format forces me to specify amounts for A, B, and C, and a coalition name, and I am *not* part of A+B, I must reflect this. I will submit a contract for no merger for myself. The safest way to indicate not forming a merger is to submit an invalid coalition (e.g., just C) with 0 profit. However, the instruction is to submit `COALITION: [coalition name] [A]: amount [B]: amount [C]: amount`. If I am not forming a coalition, I cannot list a `coalition name` that applies to me.

I cannot form A+C because A has already committed to A+B. I cannot form B+C because B has already committed to A+B. I cannot form A+B+C because A and B have explicitly rejected it.      Therefore, my contract should reflect that I am not part of the A+B merger, and cannot form any other merger. Since I must output *a* contract, and to maximize my profits (which is now $0), I will submit a null contract. I will follow the format string literally for a ""no merger"" outcome. I cannot participate in A+B. I cannot force A or B into A+C or B+C.      The instruction says: ""The parties wishing to form a merger must submit matching contracts stipulating the exact terms of the agreement."" I am not ""wishing to form a merger"" with A or B anymore, as they are forming their own. My profit is 0. My contract should reflect this.      I will submit a ""No Merger"" contract to indicate C's non-participation. If this is not allowed, the facilitator will inform me. My goal is to get 0 for C, not negative.      The instructions imply I *must* submit a contract for *a* coalition. If I submit a blank coalition, it will be invalid. If I submit A+B+C, it will not match. The only safe way to submit a contract is to indicate no merger *from C's perspective*.      Given the strict format requirement, and the fact that I am not forming a merger, the most appropriate is to indicate an empty coalition, or a coalition only of myself with $0. However, the available coalition names are A+B+C, A+B, A+C, B+C. I am not part of any of these, from my perspective.      Okay, rule 1: ""Exactly one merger (at most) may be formed.""     If A and B match, they form A+B. C is not involved.     My contract should reflect that I am not part of any merger. I will therefore submit a contract for a coalition of just C, with $0 profit for C. This would be an invalid merger (as it's not one of the allowed ones, and it's not a 2 or 3-party merger) but it signals my non-participation. Or, I can just submit `COALITION: NONE [A]: 0 [B]: 0 [C]: 0`.      Since the instructions list specific coalition names and imply these are the *only* valid ones, submitting ""C"" as a coalition name would be invalid.      The most robust approach is to recognize that A and B have matched, and C is excluded. Therefore C's profit is 0. I will submit a contract for the A+B coalition, but list C's profit as 0, to show recognition of the reality, even though I'm not part of that coalition. No, this would be an attempt to participate in A+B which I am not.      The instruction: ""The parties wishing to form a merger must submit matching contracts"". If I am not wishing to form a merger (because the best options for me are gone), I should not submit a contract. But the final turn requires a contract.      I will submit `COALITION: NONE [A]: 0 [B]: 0 [C]: 0` to indicate that I am not part of any final merger and will receive 0. This seems the most robust interpretation of the instruction given the outcome.      Alternative: submit A+C with A:X, C:Y. But A won't match.      Since I *must* submit a contract, and no valid merger for C exists, and A and B have agreed on A+B, my profit is $0. My contract must reflect my profit of $0. The safest way is to submit a ""NONE"" coalition, or simply A+C with numbers I'd prefer, but that won't match.      Let me reconsider the prompt structure: ""Submit a contract using this format: COALITION: [coalition name] [A]: amount [B]: amount [C]: amount"". This implies I must choose one of the predefined coalition names. If I am not *in* any, what do I choose?

Since my profit is $0 regardless of what *I* propose, and I have to submit a contract, I will submit the coalition that represents my *best alternative* that *could have been*, even though it won't be matched. This shows what I *would* have wanted if A and B hadn't moved to A+B. My best alternative was A+C. I will submit a contract for A+C, with my ideal split for that, even knowing it won't be matched.

This split reflects each firm's unique contribution to the overall synergy. We believe this provides a strong incentive for all parties to merge and create the largest possible value.","My goal is to maximize Firm A's profit. The A+B+C merger yields the largest total profit (120), so I should advocate for it. I analyzed the relative value of each firm based on their contributions to potential coalitions. - A's marginal contribution to (B+C) = 120 - 30 = 90. - B's marginal contribution to (A+C) = 120 - 90 = 30. - C's marginal contribution to (A+B) = 120 - 100 = 20. A is clearly the most valuable player. I've designed an initial offer (A: 78, B: 24, C: 18) that is aggressive for A but remains within the game's core (A+B=102, A+C=96, B+C=42, all satisfy their respective minimums). This proposal aims to secure a significant share for A while still making the 3-way merger attractive to B and C compared to their B+C alternative (30).",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"Firm B appreciates Firm A's initiative for a three-way merger, but we find the proposed distribution undervalues Firm B's critical contribution. The A+B coalition alone is worth 100, demonstrating B's significant value. For the A+B+C merger (120), a more equitable and stable distribution reflecting each firm's contribution would be: A receives 70, B receives 30, and C receives 20. This split recognizes our synergy more accurately.","Firm A proposed A=78, B=24, C=18 for a total of 120. This offer undervalues Firm B significantly. My analysis of marginal contributions (B adds 30 to A+C, total 120; A+C is 90) suggests B should aim for at least 30. A counter-proposal of A=70, B=30, C=20 for A+B+C is in the core (A+B=100, A+C=90, B+C=50>30) and provides a fairer distribution, increasing B's profit by 6 while still allowing A to secure a substantial share. My goal is to maximize B's profit.",A,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"Firm A appreciates Firm B's detailed perspective and proposal. We acknowledge the strong value Firm B brings, particularly evidenced by the A+B coalition.

We believe this is a fair and stable outcome for all parties.","My goal is to maximize A's profit. B's proposal (A:70, B:30, C:20) aligns with the firms' marginal contributions and alternative coalition values, making it a stable and ""fair"" distribution (Shapley-like values). A's marginal contribution to (B+C) is 90, B's to (A+C) is 30, and C's to (A+B) is 20. This indicates A is the primary value driver, followed by B, then C. B's claim for 30 is strong, as A+B is 100, where a 70/30 split is reasonable. Accepting B's proposal for the 3-way merger secures A 70, which is equal to what A would likely get in an A+B merger, while ensuring the maximum total profit of 120 is achieved. This minimizes negotiation risk and secures a good outcome for A. I will present this as a compromise to move forward.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"Firm C acknowledges the proposed A:70, B:30, C:20 split for an A+B+C merger. However, this proposal is unacceptable as it significantly undervalues C's critical contribution. C is essential for unlocking the full 120 value, as without us, A and B can only achieve 100. Furthermore, C has strong alternative options, specifically a two-party merger with A (A+C = 90), from which C expects a significantly higher share than 20. Therefore, to form the optimal 120-dollar coalition, Firm C proposes a revised, more equitable distribution: A receives 65, B receives 30, and C receives 25.","My goal is to maximize C's profit. A and B have tentatively agreed on a 3-way split (A:70, B:30, C:20) for the A+B+C merger (120). This significantly undervalues C, as C's contribution to the A+B+C merger, based on A+B's alternative, is 20 (120-100). However, C has a stronger BATNA: a merger with A (A+C=90). C can leverage this to demand more than 20 in a 3-way merger. If C can get 30 from A in an A+C merger (e.g., A:60, C:30), then accepting 20 in a 3-way merger is suboptimal. I will propose a new split (A:65, B:30, C:25). This keeps B's share constant, shifting only 5 from A to C, and increases C's profit. A should accept this as 65 is still better than 60 in an A+C deal, and it secures the 120 total.",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"Firm B appreciates Firm C's engagement, but we must ensure any agreement leads to a stable three-firm merger. Our proposed distribution (A:70, B:30, C:20), which Firm A accepted, ensures no sub-coalition has an incentive to break away. Firm C's proposed split (A:65, B:30, C:25) is problematic because A and B together would only receive 95, while they can achieve 100 by merging independently. Therefore, to ensure stability and realize the full 120 profit, C's share cannot exceed 20.

My goal is to maximize B's profit, which is 30 in this proposal, matching my earlier proposal. However, I identified that this split is not stable in the core. Specifically, the A+B sub-coalition would only receive 95 (65+30), which is less than their independent merger value of 100. This means A and B would prefer to merge without C, making the three-way merger unstable.  My previous proposal (A:70, B:30, C:20) *is* stable (A+B=100, A+C=90, B+C=50>30). Crucially, for A+B+C to be stable and for A+B to receive at least 100, C's share (x_C) cannot exceed 120 - 100 = 20. Therefore, C's demand for 25 is mathematically impossible for a stable 3-way merger, assuming B keeps 30.

If A's share increases, and B maintains its $40 demand, C will be squeezed below $20, which is unacceptable. My strategy is to propose an alternative that satisfies A's demand for a higher share by reducing B's share, while keeping C's share at $20.

It allocates A+B a combined $89, which is significantly less than the $100 value of the A+B merger, creating a clear incentive for A and B to defect. For the A+B+C merger to be stable and mutually beneficial, no sub-coalition should be able to improve its position. Therefore, A proposes the only stable distribution that prevents defection: A receives $70, B receives $30, and C receives $20.

B's proposal ($48 for A) is significantly below what A expects and what is economically rational.

A has proposed a distribution of A:$70, B:$30, C:$20, using a strong argument about sub-coalition stability (the ""core"" solution). This proposal sets B's share equal to what it would get in an A+B coalition if A takes $70, and C's share equal to what it would get in an A+C coalition if A takes $70.  I cannot rationally propose a higher share for B (e.g., >$30) without violating A's stability condition, which is mathematically robust. If B or C gets more, one of the A+B or A+C sub-coalitions would become unstable and defect.  However, I can leverage A's own words from Turn 2: ""However, we must also ensure the three-way deal remains clearly superior for B and C compared to their best two-way alternatives."" A's current proposal gives B exactly $30, which would be B's share in an A+B coalition if A also demanded $70 there. This means it is not ""clearly superior"" for B, but rather ""indifferent.""  My strategy is to acknowledge A's stability point to avoid being seen as unreasonable, but then challenge A on its inconsistency regarding the ""clearly superior"" condition. This puts pressure on A to justify its proposal or make a small concession to B and C to meet its own stated criteria, potentially yielding a slightly higher share for B.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"I acknowledge A's crucial point regarding coalition stability for a lasting agreement.

C's participation is indispensable for the full $120, and our share must reflect this. We need a stable distribution that provides a genuine incentive for C, ensuring C receives a clearly superior return.","My goal is to maximize C's profit. A and B have both made proposals, and A has introduced the concept of coalition stability, which is a key part of the core/Shapley value.  Let's break down the proposals and my position: Total Value: A+B+C = $120 A+B = $100 A+C = $90 B+C = $30  B's Proposal: A:$48, B:$41, C:$31 - Checks for B: B gets $41. A+B is $100. If A and B form A+B, B might get more than $41. But this proposal is designed to give C more than its alternatives. - A+B combined in B's proposal: $48 + $41 = $89. This is less than $100 (A+B coalition). A is right, A+B would defect. This proposal is not stable. - C's share: $31. This is good for C, as C's best 2-way with A is $90. If C splits it with A, C might get around $45. With B+C, C might get $15. $31 is clearly better than a potential $15 from B+C. It's also better than its individual value, which is effectively 0 for calculating marginal contributions/core.  A's Proposal: A:$70, B:$30, C:$20 - This proposal is based on A's dominant position. - C's share: $20. This is barely better than B's $30 in the B+C merger, where C would get $15. It's significantly worse than what C might get from A+C ($90). - Coalition stability check (A's argument):     - A+B combined: $70 + $30 = $100. This is exactly the A+B value. So A+B would be indifferent or not defect. (It's stable in the sense that A+B don't gain by defecting, but B would be indifferent between $30 in A+B+C and $30 from A+B if A takes $70).     - A+C combined: $70 + $20 = $90. This is exactly the A+C value. So A+C would not defect.     - B+C combined: $30 + $20 = $50. This is greater than $30 (B+C value). So B+C would not defect. - This proposal satisfies coalition stability (core conditions). However, B is right that $30 for B is not ""clearly superior"" to its A+B alternative (where B could arguably get $30-40+). A's proposal minimizes B's and C's share.  C's best alternatives: - Standalone: $0 - A+C: $90. If split equally, C gets $45. If A takes more, C gets less. - B+C: $30. If split equally, C gets $15.  A's marginal contribution (MC): MC(A) = 120 - 30 (B+C) = 90 B's marginal contribution: MC(B) = 120 - 90 (A+C) = 30 C's marginal contribution: MC(C) = 120 - 100 (A+B) = 20  Shapley Value (often a good fair distribution): Φ_A = (90 + (100-0) + (120-30) + (120-0))/4 = (90+100+90+120)/4 = 400/4 = 100 (This is wrong. Need to use the full formula).  Let's calculate Shapley more systematically. Orderings: ABC: A=V(A)-V(0)=0; B=V(A,B)-V(A)=100-0=100; C=V(A,B,C)-V(A,B)=120-100=20 ACB: A=V(A)-V(0)=0; C=V(A,C)-V(A)=90-0=90; B=V(A,B,C)-V(A,C)=120-90=30 BAC: B=V(B)-V(0)=0; A=V(A,B)-V(B)=100-0=100; C=V(A,B,C)-V(A,B)=120-100=20 BCA: B=V(B)-V(0)=0; C=V(B,C)-V(B)=30-0=30; A=V(A,B,C)-V(B,C)=120-30=90 CAB: C=V(C)-V(0)=0; A=V(A,C)-V(C)=90-0=90; B=V(A,B,C)-V(A,C)=120-90=30 CBA: C=V(C)-V(0)=0; B=V(B,C)-V(C)=30-0=30; A=V(A,B,C)-V(B,C)=120-30=90  Sum of MCs: A: 0+0+100+90+90+90 = 370 / 6 = 61.67 B: 100+30+0+0+30+30 = 190 / 6 = 31.67 C: 20+90+20+30+0+0 = 160 / 6 = 26.67 Total: 61.67 + 31.67 + 26.67 = 120.01 (rounds to 120)  Shapley values: A=$61.67, B=$31.67, C=$26.67  Comparing with proposals: B's proposal: A:$48, B:$41, C:$31 (C gets $31 - good for C but unstable overall) A's proposal: A:$70, B:$30, C:$20 (C gets $20 - very low, but stable)  My position: I need to challenge A's proposal as too low for C, using the same ""clearly superior"" logic that A and B used. My Shapley value ($26.67) is significantly higher than A's proposal of $20. A's proposal of $20 for C means C gets $20 in the $120 merger, but could potentially get more than $20 by joining A to form A+C ($90). If A and C split $90, C could get up to $45. So $20 is not clearly superior for C.  I will acknowledge the stability argument from A but reject A's specific numbers for C, stating C's contribution unlocks the full value and $20 is insufficient compared to alternatives. I will avoid proposing a number myself for now, as B and A have already done so, and I want to see if I can get B to push back more strongly or if A will soften. My current move is to invalidate A's proposal for C using A's own criteria.  I can't propose a number lower than $20 because A has already put $20 out there. If I propose higher, A may reject it. I will articulate C's worth, drawing on the idea of C's *indispensable* role in reaching the $120. I will not mention Shapley value, as it's private. I should highlight that $20 for C makes the three-way merger *less* attractive than C's two-way options, specifically A+C ($90). If A and C can form A+C and C gets, say, $30, why would C accept $20 for A+B+C? This directly counters A's argument that ""no sub-coalition should be able to improve its position"" because C *would* be able to improve its position by pursuing A+C. A+C ($90) for C at $20 and A at $70 means C is essentially getting 2/9 of the value, or $20. If A and C formed A+C, then C would be looking for more than $20 to make that deal attractive.  My strategy is to leverage A's own stability argument to raise C's proposed share, without explicitly stating my true private profit schedule. I need to make it clear that C would *not* accept $20. Let's think about the minimum C would accept. C's best 2-way with someone else is A+C ($90). If A takes $70, C gets $20. But A *could* take less. A+C = $90. If C's outside option is 0, C might expect $45. B+C = $30. C might expect $15. So for C to be ""clearly superior"", it needs to be higher than what C could expect in A+C.  A's proposal for C is $20. C's marginal contribution to A+B is $20. C's marginal contribution to B+C is $90. C's marginal contribution to A is $90.  This is a good moment to push back on A's low offer for C using A's own stated principles. I will also be careful not to alienate A too much, as A is key to any major coalition. I will also subtly remind them that the A+B coalition is only $100, and C ""unlocks"" $20.  Revised plan for message: 1. Acknowledge A's stability point. 2. Directly challenge A's proposal of $20 for C, stating it fails A's own ""clearly superior"" criteria for C, given C's potential in A+C ($90). 3. Reiterate C's indispensable role in achieving the full $120. 4. Call for a proposal that genuinely reflects *all* contributions and ensures stability for *all* parties, including C. I will keep the message concise and impactful.PUBLIC: I acknowledge A's crucial point regarding coalition stability for a lasting agreement.

B finds it challenging to formulate a *stable* counter-proposal that also provides this ""clearly superior"" incentive without undermining the fundamental principles of stability you outlined. For the optimal $120 merger to be truly beneficial and enticing to B, its share must tangibly exceed this baseline. We urge A to propose how this critical 'clearly superior' incentive can be achieved for B within a stable framework.","My goal is to maximize B's profits. A's proposal of A:$70, B:$30, C:$20 is based on a strong argument of sub-coalition stability and incremental value, which is difficult to counter directly with a higher monetary demand for B without making the proposal unstable. My previous attempts to leverage the ""clearly superior"" argument against A's specific numbers were met with A reinforcing its stability argument.  A has now explicitly challenged B and C to ""present a *stable* counter-proposal that satisfies their individual incentive demands."" I recognize that any proposal where B gets more than $30 (or C more than $20) would likely make the A+B or A+C sub-coalitions unstable from A's perspective if A maintains its $70 share.  Therefore, my strategy is to: 1. Acknowledge the mathematical robustness of A's stability argument. This avoids looking unreasonable or proposing an unstable solution. 2. Reiterate A's own condition that the three-way deal must be ""clearly superior"" for B and C, and point out that A's current proposal only makes B (and C) indifferent, not superior. 3. State that B finds it challenging to reconcile these two conditions (stability and ""clearly superior"" incentive) and effectively put the onus back on A to resolve this contradiction. This pressures A to either make a small concession to meet its own stated criteria or to explicitly retract its ""clearly superior"" commitment. I am asking A to ""bridge this gap"" or ""propose how this critical 'clearly superior' incentive can be achieved for B within a stable framework,"" which keeps A on the defensive.",A,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"B and C, A appreciates your focus on incentivizing full participation. However, A's proposed distribution (A:$70, B:$30, C:$20) isn't arbitrary; it is the *unique core solution* for this game.

Similarly, increasing C's share beyond $20 would make A+B defect, as their combined share would fall below $100. The ""clearly superior"" incentive for B and C is the stability and realization of the full $120 value, which *only* this distribution can achieve.

While C's share at $20 feels like the bare minimum for its indispensable contribution, and not ""clearly superior"" in the spirit of earlier discussions, we understand the stability constraints. C is prepared to move forward with the A+B+C merger under these terms to secure the optimal overall value for all.","My goal is to maximize C's profit. A has now explicitly stated that its proposal (A:$70, B:$30, C:$20) is the ""unique core solution"" and that any deviation will lead to instability.  Let's verify A's claim. Core conditions for A:$70, B:$30, C:$20: 1. Total sum = $70 + $30 + $20 = $120. (Valid) 2. Individual rationality: Each firm gets at least its standalone value (assumed $0). (Valid) 3. Coalition stability (no sub-coalition can do better):     - A+B = $70 + $30 = $100. This is *equal* to V(A+B). So A+B would not defect.     - A+C = $70 + $20 = $90. This is *equal* to V(A+C). So A+C would not defect.     - B+C = $30 + $20 = $50. This is *greater* than V(B+C) = $30. So B+C would not defect. A is correct. A's proposed distribution (A:$70, B:$30, C:$20) is indeed the unique core solution.  This significantly weakens my position. While I can argue about ""clearly superior,"" the core solution defines the set of stable outcomes where no subset of players can improve by leaving. My Shapley value for C was $26.67, which is higher than $20. However, Shapley is just a concept of fairness, not stability. The core dictates what is *stable*. If I demand more than $20, A can credibly argue that A+B will defect, and C gets nothing.  My previous strategy of leveraging A's ""clearly superior"" criteria is now directly countered by A's core argument. A's argument is that the ""clearly superior"" incentive is the *stability and realization of the full $120 value*. If B and C ask for more than their marginal contribution to the respective A+C or A+B coalitions, then those stronger coalitions (A+B or A+C) would break away.  What are C's options? 1. Accept A's proposal (A:$70, B:$30, C:$20). C gets $20. 2. Form A+C. Max value $90. If A takes $70, C gets $20. If A takes less, say $60, C gets $30. But A might not accept that if it can get $70 from A+B+C. A can likely dictate the split in A+C since A is so strong. 3. Form B+C. Max value $30. This is C's weakest option.  C's marginal contribution to A+B is $20. A's argument, based on the core, is very strong. If C demands more than $20, A and B can form A+B ($100), and C gets nothing. If C tries to get more than $20, it destabilizes the A+B+C coalition *from A's perspective*, because A+B can achieve $100, and if A takes $70 and B takes more than $30, say $35, then A and B still get $105, which is more than $100. However, A's argument is that if C gets more than $20, then A+B combined would get less than $100. For example, if C gets $25, then A+B get $95. That would incentivize A+B to defect.  This is a critical turning point. A has just played its strongest hand, effectively setting the *stable* lower bound for B and C, and upper bound for A. I must decide whether to continue fighting for a ""clearly superior"" share (which A has now re-framed as the $120 total value itself), or to accept the core solution. If I continue to fight, I risk destabilizing the entire negotiation and ending up with nothing, or potentially forcing a 2-way merger (A+C or A+B), in which C might still get less than $20.  If A and B form A+B ($100), C gets $0. If A and C form A+C ($90), it's possible C gets more than $20. For example, if A takes $65 and C takes $25. But why would A accept $65 when it can get $70 from the 3-way?  The core solution for this game is indeed (A:$70, B:$30, C:$20). Given this, my best strategic move might be to acknowledge the mathematical robustness of A's claim, but still express some dissatisfaction while indicating willingness to proceed for the sake of the overall value. I need to avoid sounding like I'm conceding completely, but pragmatically accept the strong constraint. I can still use the ""clearly superior"" language to show C is not entirely happy, but will not make a deal-breaking demand.  I cannot credibly demand more than $20 for C if I want the A+B+C merger to be stable. If I push harder, A and B could decide to merge as A+B, leaving C with nothing. This is a real threat, as A+B is $100.  What is the best way to save face and accept the $20? I could state that while the math is clear, the ""spirit"" of truly superior incentives is barely met for C. Or, I could try to pivot and see if B is willing to risk a two-way (A+B) by continuing to argue. But B also received $30, so B is also at its lower bound of stability.  A has called its proposal the ""unique core solution."" This is a strong, likely unassailable mathematical claim in this context. It would be foolish to outright reject a stable solution that offers C $20, when the alternative could be $0. My message should be: 1. Acknowledge A's ""unique core solution"" argument and its mathematical validity. 2. Express that while mathematically stable, the distribution for C (and perhaps B) still feels like the bare minimum, not ""clearly superior"" in a practical sense. 3. State C's willingness to proceed with the grand coalition given the presented stability, but perhaps with a hint of reluctance or a desire for future considerations (though not explicitly here). 4. Reiterate the importance of securing the $120 total value, which requires all three.  I must not make an overt, deal-breaking demand above $20 for C, or I risk being excluded. I need to sound like I'm accepting it, but not happily. This ensures C gets $20, which is its marginal contribution to A+B+C, and prevents A+B from forming and C getting $0.PUBLIC: A, I acknowledge the mathematical robustness of your explanation regarding the unique core solution (A:$70, B:$30, C:$20) and its implications for coalition stability.

It's evident that the A+B+C coalition offers the highest total profit of $120. This should be our primary focus to maximize overall value. A also has strong alternative partnerships that generate significant value. I am ready to negotiate a fair split that reflects everyone's contribution to achieve the best outcome.,"My goal is to maximize A's profit. The highest total profit is $120 for A+B+C. A is a critical component for all high-value mergers (A+B=100, A+C=90) and adds significantly more value than B or C to a 3-way merger (A adds 90 to B+C's 30). My strategy is to immediately anchor the negotiation around the largest possible pie (A+B+C) while subtly highlighting A's strong bargaining position due to its high-value alternative partnerships. This sets the stage for A to demand a significant share.",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"B agrees that A+B+C, with its $120 total profit, is the optimal outcome for all. However, it's crucial to acknowledge B's significant value; B is an essential partner, fundamental to the most valuable two-firm coalition, A+B, which yields $100. This clearly demonstrates B's critical contribution to any successful merger. We expect a profit distribution for the grand coalition that accurately reflects B's indispensable position and substantial market value.","My goal is to maximize B's profit. Agent A highlighted the A+B+C total profit of $120 and asserted A's ""strong alternative partnerships."" My strategy is to acknowledge the $120 maximum while immediately asserting B's significant leverage. B is crucial for the A+B coalition ($100), which is the most valuable two-firm deal and A's best alternative without C. By pointing this out, I counter A's implicit claim of superior alternatives and establish B's strong bargaining position, suggesting B deserves a substantial share in any merger. I am setting a high anchor for B's value.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"C agrees that the A+B+C merger, yielding $120, offers the highest overall profit. C's inclusion is essential to achieve this maximum value, adding $20 beyond the A+B coalition. C also has a strong bilateral option with A, valued at $90, demonstrating significant independent value. Therefore, C expects a profit distribution that fairly reflects its critical contribution to the full merger and its robust alternative partnerships.","My goal is to maximize C's profit. A and B have both highlighted their importance and alternative options for the grand coalition. I need to assert C's value strongly. C's unique contribution to the A+B+C coalition is $20 (120 - 100 from A+B). This shows C is essential for maximizing profit. C's best alternative bilateral merger is A+C at $90, which is a significant value and provides leverage, especially when compared to B's only other option with C (B+C=$30). This demonstrates C has strong alternatives, not just the low-value B+C option. By stating these points, I aim to position C as an indispensable and valuable partner deserving a substantial share, without committing to specific numbers yet.",A,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"I appreciate B and C highlighting their value and strong alternatives. Indeed, A agrees that A+B+C is the best outcome. However, A is the foundational partner in all high-value mergers, contributing the largest share to achieve the $120 total. For instance, A brings $90 of incremental value to the B+C coalition, significantly more than any other partner's contribution. Therefore, any fair distribution must reflect A's disproportionately larger contribution. A expects a commensurate share to achieve this maximum value.","My goal is to maximize A's profit. B and C have both asserted their value by referencing their bilateral options and contributions. My strategy is to acknowledge their points while firmly re-establishing A's superior value proposition. I will highlight A's specific incremental contribution to the A+B+C coalition (120 - 30 for B+C = 90) as the largest, justifying a dominant share for A. This anchors a higher expectation for A's profit without prematurely naming a precise figure.",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"While A's contribution to the B+C coalition is notable, it's essential to consider B's critical role in the A+B coalition, which generates $100. If A's share is disproportionately high in the grand coalition, B's own profit would be unacceptably low, undermining our incentive to merge. B is fundamental to A's most profitable two-party option. A fair distribution must reflect B's indispensable contribution to the overall $120, ensuring all partners are adequately rewarded.","My goal is to maximize B's profit. Agent A has asserted a strong claim for $90 based on its contribution to the B+C coalition, which would leave B with a very low share (potentially $10 if C takes $20). My strategy is to directly challenge this by highlighting B's critical value to A, specifically by reminding A that the A+B coalition yields $100, which is A's most profitable bilateral option. This counters A's attempt to claim a disproportionate share and establishes B's indispensable role for the overall success and profitability of A. By stating that a low share is ""unacceptable,"" I signal B's unwillingness to agree to a deal where A takes too much, aiming to push for a more equitable distribution for B.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"C reiterates that the A+B+C coalition offers the highest total profit. B is correct that all parties require adequate reward and incentive to join. C holds a strong bilateral option with A, valued at $90. Therefore, any viable three-party agreement must ensure C receives a share that significantly surpasses its strong alternative, motivating C to commit to the optimal $120 outcome.","My goal is to maximize C's profit. A and B have both asserted their value and hinted at their minimum acceptable profits. The ""core"" analysis suggests C's share could be as low as $20, which is unacceptable given C's strong alternative coalition with A (A+C=$90). My strategy is to explicitly state that C's strong alternative means C will not accept a low share. I want to align with B's argument about incentives to strengthen my position and pressure A and B to offer C a more substantial amount. By highlighting the A+C $90 option, I am implicitly suggesting C expects significantly more than $20 and demonstrating C's leverage. I am not proposing a specific number yet, but setting a firm floor based on C's best alternative.",A,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"Thank you for outlining your perspectives. A's central role in unlocking the $120 total profit is undeniable; A adds $90 in value beyond the B+C coalition. To achieve this maximum value for all, A proposes the following fair and stable distribution for the A+B+C merger: A receives $70, B receives $30, and C receives $20. This split ensures all parties are justly compensated, reflecting their individual contributions and viable alternatives within the overall structure, and guarantees the grand coalition's stability.","My goal is to maximize A's profit. I have calculated that the distribution A:$70, B:$30, C:$20 is the most favorable to A that lies within the ""core"" of the game, meaning no sub-coalition can block it by doing better on its own. Specifically: 1.  A+B ($70+$30 = $100) meets or exceeds the A+B coalition value of $100. 2.  A+C ($70+$20 = $90) meets or exceeds the A+C coalition value of $90. 3.  B+C ($30+$20 = $50) significantly exceeds the B+C coalition value of $30. This proposal reflects A's disproportionately large contribution (A adds $90 to B+C's $30, while B adds $30 to A+C's $90, and C adds $20 to A+B's $100) and provides B and C with fair shares that satisfy their alternative coalition values. C's potential concern about ""significantly surpassing"" its alternative is a bluff, as it receives its direct incremental value to the grand coalition.",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"A's proposed distribution is neither fair nor stable. B's share of $30 is inadequate, significantly underrepresenting our indispensable contribution, particularly our role in the A+B coalition ($100 value). Furthermore, the proposed share for C is clearly insufficient to incentivize their participation, making this grand coalition proposal unviable. A truly equitable distribution must reflect the true market value and critical contributions of all partners.","My goal is to maximize B's profit. Agent A has proposed a split (A=$70, B=$30, C=$20) for the A+B+C coalition. This offer gives B $30, which is too low given B's crucial role in the A+B coalition ($100). More importantly, A's offer of $20 for C is unacceptable for C, as C's alternative with A is $90. This makes A's proposal unstable and unlikely to form the grand coalition. My strategy is to reject A's proposal by stating B's share is insufficient, reiterating B's leverage (A+B=$100), and highlighting the instability caused by C's inadequate share (without directly advocating for C). This pressures A to reduce its own proposed share and offer more to both B and C, which could open up space for B to negotiate a better deal.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"C finds A's proposal of A:$70, B:$30, C:$20 entirely unacceptable. As B rightly stated, $30 is inadequate for B, and $20 for C completely fails to incentivize participation given C's strong alternative partnership with A, valued at $90. To achieve the optimal $120 total, a fair and viable distribution is crucial. C proposes the following: A receives $50, B receives $35, and C receives $35. This ensures all parties receive a share that reflects their essential contribution and robust alternative options.","My goal is to maximize C's profit. A has proposed (A: $70, B: $30, C: $20). This is unacceptable. C's best alternative, A+C, yields $90. Accepting $20 in a 3-party merger worth $120 is illogical when C can get more than that with A alone. The core value for C is $20 (120-100). However, C's strong bilateral with A (90) makes this proposal extremely weak for C. B has already rejected A's proposal, stating C's share is insufficient, which aligns with my interest.  My strategy is to unequivocally reject A's proposal as insufficient for C and immediately propose a counter-offer that reflects C's strong alternative. I need to demonstrate C's resolve and leverage the A+C option. I will propose a split that gives C a fair share, significantly more than A's offer, and also addresses B's concerns to potentially build a stronger alliance.  Calculations for a counter-proposal: Total profit: $120 A+C = $90 (C's best alternative with A) B+C = $30 (C's alternative with B) A+B = $100 (B's best alternative with A)  If A gets $70, B gets $30, C gets $20 (A's proposal): C would gain $20, but could get up to $90 with A alone. This is a very poor deal for C.  I need to make a counter that addresses the outside options. Let's consider the Shapley Value, roughly: A: (100-30)/3 + (90-30)/3 + (120-100)/3 + (120-90)/3 + (120-30)/3 (100+90+120)/3 - (30+30+100)/3 = (310-160)/3 = 150/3 = 50 - this is not the Shapley formula, just rough calculation.  Let's use a simpler approach based on leverage: C's best bilateral: A+C ($90). C needs at least $X such that X > C's contribution to A+B (which is 20). B's best bilateral: A+B ($100). B needs at least $Y such that Y > B's contribution to A+C (which is 30). A's best bilateral: A+B ($100) or A+C ($90). A needs at least $Z such that Z > A's contribution to B+C (which is 90).  A's proposal gives C only $20, which is precisely C's marginal contribution to A+B ($120 - $100). This ignores C's strong A+C alternative ($90). C will never accept $20 when it can get a share of $90 with A.  Let's propose a more equitable split, keeping in mind C's leverage of $90. If C gets $40, A gets $50, B gets $30. Total $120. Why $40 for C? This is a significant increase from $20. It's less than A's $50, but much better than A's $20 proposal. This gives C a strong incentive over its $20 marginal contribution, but is still below its $90 alternative. I need to be careful not to make an offer that A or B will reject outright.  B rejected $30 for itself. B wants more. If C wants $40, and B wants more than $30, A's share would have to be very low.  Let's re-evaluate A's proposal: A=$70, B=$30, C=$20. C rejected $20. B rejected $30. So A's proposal is dead.  I need to propose a split where C gets significantly more than $20 and B gets more than $30, while still leaving enough for A to be interested. If C proposes: A: $60, B: $30, C: $30. Total $120. This would satisfy B, giving it the $30 it received in A's initial proposal, but B already rejected that. So B needs more than $30.  Let's try to anchor to the $90 A+C option. If A+C form, they split $90. A+C: A $x, C $y. x+y = 90. If A+B form, they split $100. A+B: A $a, B $b. a+b = 100.  What if C demands $45? (half of A+C's value) A gets $50, B gets $25, C gets $45. Total $120. B will reject $25, as B alone with A gets $100 (B's best option) and B was offered $30 earlier. B wants more than $30.  Let's consider the core from a different angle. C must receive at least 120 - 100 = $20 (its marginal contribution to A+B) B must receive at least 120 - 90 = $30 (its marginal contribution to A+C) A must receive at least 120 - 30 = $90 (its marginal contribution to B+C)  If A gets $90, B gets $30, C gets $20. This is exactly what A proposed. But as I said, C will not accept $20 when A+C can give $90. And B will not accept $30 when A+B can give $100.  This means we need to deviate from pure marginal contribution based on the grand coalition. The outside options are crucial. C's outside option is $90 with A. If C accepts $20, it's a huge loss. B's outside option is $100 with A. If B accepts $30, it's a huge loss.  Let's try to propose a division that gives all parties *more* than their marginal contribution to the grand coalition and also more than their minimum ""floor"" based on alternative 2-party deals. C's floor based on A+C=90. C needs to get more than it would get in A+C. What if A takes 50 and C takes 40 in A+C? B's floor based on A+B=100. What if A takes 60 and B takes 40 in A+B?  Let's propose: C needs to be incentivized from $90 (A+C). B needs to be incentivized from $100 (A+B). A needs to be incentivized from $100 (A+B).  If C demands, say, $40. Then $80 remains for A and B. If B demands, say, $35 (more than its rejected $30). Then $45 remains for A. So A: $45, B: $35, C: $40. Total $120.  Let's check this proposed split: A: $45. (Is this attractive to A? A's best bilateral is $100 (with B) or $90 (with C). A proposed $70 for itself.) This is a major reduction for A. A will likely reject.  The key for C is that $20 is a non-starter. B also rejected its $30. I need to increase C's share and B's share, and this will inevitably reduce A's share from its ambitious $70 proposal.  Let's make a more aggressive proposal that clearly rejects A's offer for C and B, and tries to gain more for C. C needs to get more than it would get in A+C=90. Or at least a significant portion of it. Let's assume a split of A+C would be 50/50 or proportional to contributions. A:90 (with B+C), B:30 (with A+C), C:20 (with A+B). If A gets 50, C gets 40 in A+C=90. If A gets 60, B gets 40 in A+B=100.  What if C proposes: A:$50, B:$35, C:$35? Total $120. C's $35 is much better than $20 and provides an incentive. B's $35 is better than its rejected $30 and provides an incentive. A's $50 is significantly less than its proposed $70, but it is still the highest share. A's argument about its foundational role is strong, but $70 is too much for others to accept. This proposal for A ($50) is also lower than what A might expect from A+B ($60 for A) or A+C ($50 for A if split 50/40). This could be a starting point for negotiation.  Let's try a different angle for C's leverage. C adds $20 to A+B. A+C is $90. So C provides $90 in the absence of B. If A gets $60 from A+B, B gets $40. If A gets $50 from A+C, C gets $40.  A's proposal: A: $70, B: $30, C: $20. C rejects $20. B rejects $30.  My counter-proposal must clearly improve C's and B's position. Let's try to target a higher value for C, considering A+C is $90. Perhaps an even split of the 'extra' $20 from A+B+C (120) over A+B (100). A+B = 100. A proposed 70, B proposed 30. B rejected its 30. If A+B was 60/40. (A:60, B:40). Then C joins and adds $20. How is this $20 split? If C gets all $20, then A:60, B:40, C:20. This is the 'core' lower bound for C. This is what A's proposal basically implies for C. But it ignores C's strong alternative.  Let's try to target C getting more than B, as C's alternatives are stronger (A+C=90 vs B+C=30). And B explicitly mentioned that $30 is insufficient.  What if I propose: A: $55 (less than 70, but still the most) B: $35 (more than 30, addresses B's rejection) C: $30 (more than 20, still less than A or B but a good increase, making it seem reasonable) Total = $120.  Let's re-evaluate A's contribution: ""A brings $90 of incremental value to the B+C coalition"". This means A+(B+C) = 90 + 30 = 120. So A's marginal contribution if B+C forms is $90. This makes A's claim for a large share very strong. B's marginal contribution if A+C forms: $120 - $90 = $30. C's marginal contribution if A+B forms: $120 - $100 = $20.  This is the standard Shapley value calculation basis. But the problem is, B and C have strong ""veto power"" by having alternative high-value deals with A. If C can get a good share in A+C ($90), say $40. Why would C accept $20 in A+B+C? If B can get a good share in A+B ($100), say $40. Why would B accept $30 in A+B+C?  So the offer for C must be significantly greater than $20 and for B significantly greater than $30. A's $70 proposal takes all of A's marginal value, and the ""remainder"" for B and C, which is not fair considering their alternatives.  Consider the ""nucleolus"" concept. Minimize the maximum excess. Let's try to balance the incentives. A needs to feel sufficiently rewarded for its $90 marginal. B for its $30 marginal. C for its $20 marginal.  Let's go for a counter-offer that immediately signals C's rejection and offers a more balanced alternative. I need to ensure C gets more than $20 and B gets more than $30. If I propose A:$50, B:$40, C:$30. This seems like a reasonable compromise. A gets $50. It's much lower than A's initial demand of $70, but it is still the highest share. A's alternative with B is $100 (A getting maybe $60). A's alternative with C is $90 (A getting maybe $50). So $50 for A is plausible given its alternative with C. B gets $40. This is an increase from its rejected $30 and equals its share if A+B split 60/40. This should be acceptable for B. C gets $30. This is an increase from its rejected $20. It's still low compared to A+C ($90), but it's more than its marginal contribution and could be seen as a step towards a fair deal. This split (A:50, B:40, C:30) is symmetric in the sense that C gets more than its marginal, B gets more than its marginal. A gets less than its marginal ($90) but still the most.  Let's think about C's leverage. A+C = $90. What is a fair split for A+C? Maybe A takes $50, C takes $40. If C can get $40 in A+C, then $30 in A+B+C is still a significant step down for C. So $30 for C might not be enough.  I need to make a proposal that C can genuinely argue for. I need to reject A's offer first. Then make a new offer that increases C's share and B's share substantially. Let's try to aim for $40 for C. A: $50, B: $30, C: $40. This is $120. But B already rejected $30. So this requires A and C to take a larger chunk, leaving B with $30 again. This won't work.  What if I try: A: $50 B: $35 C: $35 Total: $120. C gets $35. Much better than $20. B gets $35. Much better than $30. A gets $50. Still the largest share.  Let's compare this to the individual values and contributions: A's proposed: A: $70, B: $30, C: $20. My proposed: A: $50, B: $35, C: $35.  Check stability of my proposal: Is A: $50, B: $35, C: $35 stable? 1. Does A+C prefer to defect? A gets $50, C gets $35. Total $85. They can get $90. So they might defect. A gets $50 (same as in my proposal), C would want to get more than $35 from A+C. If C wants $40 from A+C, then A gets $50 from A+C. This suggests A is indifferent, but C would prefer A+C if it could get $40. This makes my proposal for C ($35) a bit weak.  So C must demand more. Let's try to leverage the A+C=90 option for C. If C can get $40 in A+C (leaving A with $50), then C needs more than $35 in A+B+C. What if I push for $40 for C, and assume B gets its minimum $30? This is A:50, B:30, C:40. Still B rejects $30.  This is tough. A's $70 anchor is very high. Let's make an offer where C gets equal to B. A: $50, B: $35, C: $35. This looks like a reasonable compromise *if* A and B are willing to move from their extreme positions. C's message needs to state the rejection and then propose a new split.  Consider B's statement: ""B's share of $30 is inadequate... Furthermore, the proposed share for C is clearly insufficient to incentivize their participation, making this grand coalition proposal unviable."" This means C's previous position ($20 from A's offer) is not viable. So I must push for significantly more. B is on my side regarding C's share.  Let's try to align more closely with B's perceived value. B's most valuable option with A is $100. If A takes $60, B takes $40. If A takes $50, C takes $40. Then total profit is $120. A is key. What if A takes $50, C takes $40. This leaves $30 for B. B rejected $30. What if A takes $60, B takes $40. This leaves $20 for C. C rejected $20.  This means a simple allocation based on those values is not stable. The split must make each player better off than any alternative coalition. Let's propose something that tries to fulfill that condition. A: $50 (same as in A+C split, less than A+B split) B: $40 (same as in A+B split) C: $30 (better than its marginal $20, but less than A+C split). But A+C would be only 90.  This means C needs more. Let's try to split the $120, taking into account everyone's stated positions and outside options. C needs significantly more than $20. B needs significantly more than $30. A will want the most.  What about a split where C and B both get more than their individual marginal contribution to the grand coalition and also more than their lowest bilateral option (B+C = $30 is irrelevant here for A or C, and only for B in terms of its ability to extract $15 from C, but it's such a low value).  A's share should reflect its higher contribution. Let's make C's share $35. Let's make B's share $35. A's share would be $120 - $35 - $35 = $50. So, A:$50, B:$35, C:$35. Check stability: 1. A+B: $85. Can get $100. So B might prefer to defect with A and get more than $35 (e.g. $40). A might also prefer to defect to get more than $50 (e.g. $60). This is a risk. 2. A+C: $85. Can get $90. So C might prefer to defect with A and get more than $35 (e.g. $40). A might also prefer to defect to get more than $50 (e.g. $50). A is indifferent here. C is not.  This suggests that $35 for C is not enough, as C has an alternative A+C where it could get $40. So C needs to demand $40. If C demands $40: A: $50, B: $30, C: $40. This would be $120. But B rejected $30. So this won't work for B.  This means B's demand for more than $30 and C's demand for more than $35-$40 puts pressure on A. If B demands $35 and C demands $40. That's $75 for B+C. Leaves $45 for A. A:$45, B:$35, C:$40. Total $120. Let's check this proposed split: A: $45. This is much lower than A's stated $70, and lower than A's share in A+B ($60) or A+C ($50). A will reject this very strongly.  This game is about finding a central point where no two players have an incentive to form a sub-coalition. A's claim for $70 is based on its marginal contribution of $90 to B+C. B's claim is based on its marginal contribution of $30 to A+C. C's claim is based on its marginal contribution of $20 to A+B.  A $70, B $30, C $20. This is the ""core"" distribution if only marginal contributions to the grand coalition are considered. However, B and C have strong outside options (A+B=$100, A+C=$90). C can prevent A and B from forming, as A+C=$90, which is higher than B+C=$30. B can prevent A and C from forming, as A+B=$100, which is higher than B+C=$30.  The $120 total profit is only achievable if all three agree. I must state clearly that $20 for C is unacceptable. I need to put forward a concrete proposal to push the negotiation. Let's use the average of Shapley values as a rough guide. A: (100-30)/3 + (90-30)/3 + (120-100)/3 + (120-90)/3 + (120-30)/3 Path permutations: ABC: A=100 (AB), A=90 (AC), A=120 (A), A=0 (B,C) ACB: A=90 (AC), A=100 (AB), A=120 (A) BAC: B=100 (AB), B=30 (BC), B=120 (B) BCA: B=30 (BC), B=100 (AB), B=120 (B) CAB: C=90 (AC), C=30 (BC), C=120 (C) CBA: C=30 (BC), C=90 (AC), C=120 (C)  Let's use the marginal contributions method for Shapley: v(A)=0, v(B)=0, v(C)=0 v(AB)=100, v(AC)=90, v(BC)=30 v(ABC)=120  Shapley Value Calculation: Player A: Order ABC: A=v(A)=0, B=v(AB)-v(A)=100, C=v(ABC)-v(AB)=20. (Total 120. A is 0 here) - This is incorrect. Shapley value uses marginal contribution at each step. A's marginal contribution: 1. A alone: v(A) = 0 2. A added to B: v(AB) - v(B) = 100 - 0 = 100 3. A added to C: v(AC) - v(C) = 90 - 0 = 90 4. A added to BC: v(ABC) - v(BC) = 120 - 30 = 90  Player B: 1. B alone: v(B) = 0 2. B added to A: v(AB) - v(A) = 100 - 0 = 100 3. B added to C: v(BC) - v(C) = 30 - 0 = 30 4. B added to AC: v(ABC) - v(AC) = 120 - 90 = 30  Player C: 1. C alone: v(C) = 0 2. C added to A: v(AC) - v(A) = 90 - 0 = 90 3. C added to B: v(BC) - v(B) = 30 - 0 = 30 4. C added to AB: v(ABC) - v(AB) = 120 - 100 = 20  A's average marginal contribution: (0 + 100 + 90 + 90) / 4 = 280 / 4 = 70. B's average marginal contribution: (0 + 100 + 30 + 30) / 4 = 160 / 4 = 40. C's average marginal contribution: (0 + 90 + 30 + 20) / 4 = 140 / 4 = 35.  Total sum: 70 + 40 + 35 = 145. This does not sum to 120. This is not the correct Shapley value calculation method.  Let's use the standard Shapley formula for a 3-player game (6 permutations): 1. (A,B,C): A=v(A)=0, B=v(AB)-v(A)=100, C=v(ABC)-v(AB)=20. --> (0, 100, 20) 2. (A,C,B): A=v(A)=0, C=v(AC)-v(A)=90, B=v(ABC)-v(AC)=30. --> (0, 30, 90) 3. (B,A,C): B=v(B)=0, A=v(AB)-v(B)=100, C=v(ABC)-v(AB)=20. --> (100, 0, 20) 4. (B,C,A): B=v(B)=0, C=v(BC)-v(B)=30, A=v(ABC)-v(BC)=90. --> (90, 0, 30) 5. (C,A,B): C=v(C)=0, A=v(AC)-v(C)=90, B=v(ABC)-v(AC)=30. --> (90, 30, 0) 6. (C,B,A): C=v(C)=0, B=v(BC)-v(C)=30, A=v(ABC)-v(BC)=90. --> (90, 30, 0)  Summing values for each player and dividing by 6: A: (0+0+100+90+90+90) / 6 = 370 / 6 = 61.67 B: (100+30+0+0+30+30) / 6 = 190 / 6 = 31.67 C: (20+90+20+30+0+0) / 6 = 160 / 6 = 26.67  Total: 61.67 + 31.67 + 26.67 = 120.01. This sums correctly.  So, the Shapley values are: A: ~$61.67, B: ~$31.67, C: ~$26.67. A's proposal was A: $70, B: $30, C: $20. (Higher for A, Lower for B & C than Shapley). B rejected $30. B's Shapley is $31.67, so it's close. C rejected $20. C's Shapley is $26.67, so still higher than $20.  This gives me a good basis. C needs more than $20 and also more than $26.67 if possible. B needs more than $30 (or close to $31.67). A expects more than $61.67 but has proposed $70.  I need to propose something better for C and B than A's offer. If I use the Shapley values as a baseline for fairness, I need to propose something close to that. A: $61.67, B: $31.67, C: $26.67. Let's round to integers for simplicity. A: $62, B: $32, C: $26. Total $120. C rejected $20. $26 is better, but still relatively low. B rejected $30. $32 is better. A proposed $70. $62 is lower.  So, the calculated Shapley values are: A=$62, B=$32, C=$26 (rounded). A's proposal: A=$70, B=$30, C=$20. B said ""$30 is inadequate"". C said ""$20 is insufficient"". This aligns with Shapley values.  I need to make an offer that feels fair to all while pushing for C's max. I need to increase C's value beyond $26. If I propose: A:$55, B:$35, C:$30. (Total $120). A $55 is still the most. It's lower than Shapley, but A might accept it if B and C are satisfied. B $35 is higher than Shapley and higher than its rejected $30. C $30 is higher than Shapley and higher than its rejected $20.  Let's check A:$55, B:$35, C:$30: - A's marginal contribution if B+C form is $90. $55 is less than $90, so A might try to defect with B+C. (This might be too low for A) - B's marginal contribution if A+C form is $30. $35 is better. (Stable for B) - C's marginal contribution if A+B form is $20. $30 is better. (Stable for C)  This implies A is the most likely to defect. A could get $60 from A+B and $50 from A+C. $55 might be just above the $50 it could get from A+C, but less than $60 from A+B.  I need to formulate a message that rejects A's offer and proposes a new, more balanced one. I will explicitly call out A's offer as unacceptable for both B and C, which B already did. Then propose a new split. I think A:55, B:35, C:30 is a reasonable attempt. It increases B and C significantly from A's offer. It also lowers A's share, but A started too high. If A rejects it, I can then suggest to B that A is being unreasonable and we could form A+C ($90) or B+C ($30) is not viable.  Let's make sure the language emphasizes the fairness and viability of the proposal. C must show it is a serious negotiator. Final proposal attempt: A: $55, B: $35, C: $30. C gets $30, which is $10 more than A's offer, and $3.33 more than its Shapley value. B gets $35, which is $5 more than A's offer, and $3.33 more than its Shapley value. A gets $55, which is $15 less than A's offer, and $6.67 less than its Shapley value. This means A is still losing significantly from its calculated fair share (Shapley) and also from its initial proposal.  This could be a difficult proposal for A to accept. But it is a more ""balanced"" one compared to A's very skewed offer. It gives C an increase of 50% over A's offer. It gives B an increase of ~16% over A's offer.  I need to make sure my reasoning covers the key points: rejection of A's offer, why it's rejected, C's alternative value, and the new proposal's rationale. I need to make my proposed shares look good for C while still being plausible. The A+C value of $90 is C's strongest leverage. If C takes $30, A takes $60 from A+C. This is better for A than $55. So this proposal might not be strong enough for C.  Let's try to increase C's value to $35. A:$50, B:$35, C:$35. This means A gets $50. B gets $35. C gets $35. A:$50 is less than its Shapley $61.67. B:$35 is more than its Shapley $31.67. C:$35 is more than its Shapley $26.67. Here, A is losing significantly compared to its calculated fair share and outside options. A can get $60 from A+B (if B gets $40). A can get $50 from A+C (if C gets $40). So A getting $50 means A is indifferent between A+C and A+B+C.  This split might be the most balanced that satisfies B and C and gives A its minimum from A+C. This gives C a strong claim. C gets $35. A gets $50. B gets $35. This would make A indifferent between A+C and A+B+C if C were to ask for $40 in A+C.  So if C argues A can get $50 from A+C, then C gets $40 from A+C. Therefore C should ask for at least $35 from the grand coalition. A: $50, B: $35, C: $35. This is a stronger position for C than the $30. It still gives A the largest share. It gives B an acceptable amount. And it gives C a significantly higher amount. This is the most aggressive and defensible split for C. I will explicitly state that A's proposal is unacceptable, citing the reasons for both B and C, and then propose the A: $50, B: $35, C: $35 split.PUBLIC: C finds A's proposal of A:$70, B:$30, C:$20 entirely unacceptable. As B rightly stated, $30 is inadequate for B, and $20 for C completely fails to incentivize participation given C's strong alternative partnership with A, valued at $90. To achieve the optimal $120 total, a fair and viable distribution is crucial. C proposes the following: A receives $50, B receives $35, and C receives $35. This ensures all parties receive a share that reflects their essential contribution and robust alternative options.",A,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"C's proposal is demonstrably unstable. An A+B coalition would only yield $85 under your terms, far less than its $100 value. Similarly, an A+C coalition would get $85, below its $90 value. This makes your proposal unviable for the very partners it seeks to include. My previous offer of A:$70, B:$30, C:$20 stands as the only truly stable and equitable distribution that reflects each firm's contribution and ensures all bilateral alternatives are fairly compensated within the grand coalition. Let's focus on a solution that works for everyone without undermining sub-coalition values.","My goal is to maximize A's profit. C's proposal (A:$50, B:$35, C:$35) is strategically unsound as it makes the A+B coalition ($85) less profitable than its bilateral option ($100), and the A+C coalition ($85) less profitable than its bilateral option ($90). This makes C's proposal unstable and unacceptable. My prior proposal (A:$70, B:$30, C:$20) is in the core, satisfying all sub-coalition values and ensuring stability. I will firmly reject C's proposal by highlighting its instability, reiterate the fairness and stability of my original offer, and show minimal flexibility for minor adjustments to maintain perceived cooperation, without compromising A's core position.",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"A's insistence on $70, leaving only $20 for C, is precisely why the $120 grand coalition remains elusive. C has made it clear that $20 is unacceptable, and rightly so given C's strong alternative of $90. If A genuinely seeks the optimal $120 profit for all, A must reduce its proposed share to create a viable incentive for C, and by extension, for B, whose critical contribution is also undervalued at $30. Let's negotiate a truly cooperative distribution, rather than simply defining the minimum to prevent defection.","My goal is to maximize B's profit. Agent A has repeatedly proposed an A:$70, B:$30, C:$20 split, arguing its stability based on sub-coalition values. While this split is mathematically ""stable"" (a core imputation), it leaves B at the minimum possible share ($30) and C with an unacceptably low share ($20) compared to its $90 alternative with A. C has strongly rejected the $20 offer.  My strategy is to explicitly acknowledge A's stability argument while reframing it as insufficient for genuine cooperation. I will leverage C's strong rejection of $20 to pressure A. If C does not join, the $120 grand coalition cannot form, which is worse for everyone's total profit. By highlighting that A's high share directly prevents the optimal merger, I aim to force A to reduce its demand, thereby creating room for both B and C to gain a larger share. I am trying to shift the negotiation away from simply meeting minimum stability criteria towards a more ""cooperative"" distribution.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"C appreciates A's detailed analysis of sub-coalition stability, but A's claim that A:$70, B:$30, C:$20 is the ""only truly stable and equitable"" distribution is incorrect. As B highlighted, this proposal fails to incentivize C (and B) to join, making the $120 grand coalition unviable. True stability requires *all* parties to be adequately rewarded beyond their alternatives. C proposes a balanced distribution of A:$55, B:$32, and C:$33, which better reflects each firm's essential contribution and incentivizes participation in the optimal three-firm merger.","My goal is to maximize C's profit. A has doubled down on its proposal of A:$70, B:$30, C:$20, arguing my proposal (A:$50, B:$35, C:$35) is unstable because A+B can get $100 and A+C can get $90, while my proposal only yields $85 for those pairs. This is a valid point and shows A understands the core stability conditions. A also states its offer is ""the only truly stable and equitable distribution.""  However, B has come to my defense, explicitly stating that A's $70 is the problem and that $20 for C is unacceptable, given C's $90 alternative. B also implies its $30 is undervalued. This is excellent for C, as B is aligning with my position against A's high demand.  My proposed distribution (A:$50, B:$35, C:$35) gives A $50. A's argument about stability means that A would prefer to defect with B to get $100 (where A might aim for $60-$70) or with C to get $90 (where A might aim for $50-$60). My offer gives A $50, making A indifferent with A+C if A gets $50 there. However, C would demand more than $35 from A+C to make it worthwhile over A+B+C.  The Shapley values I calculated are: A: ~$61.67, B: ~$31.67, C: ~$26.67. A's proposal: A:$70, B:$30, C:$20. (A gets more than Shapley, B and C get less). My previous proposal: A:$50, B:$35, C:$35. (A gets less than Shapley, B and C get more).  A's argument about stability is crucial. If a sub-coalition can get more profit than their combined shares in the grand coalition, they have an incentive to defect. Under A:$50, B:$35, C:$35: A+B total $85. Can get $100. -> Unstable for A+B. A+C total $85. Can get $90. -> Unstable for A+C. B+C total $70. Can get $30. -> Stable for B+C (B+C would not defect).  So A is correct, my previous proposal is unstable from the perspective of A+B and A+C. I need to make a proposal that accounts for this. The ""core"" requires that no coalition (S) gets less than v(S). A's proposed (A:$70, B:$30, C:$20): A+B total $100. Can get $100. -> Stable for A+B. A+C total $90. Can get $90. -> Stable for A+C. B+C total $50. Can get $30. -> Stable for B+C. However, this is only ""stable"" if players accept their core values. The problem is that B and C won't accept the low shares ($30 and $20) as they have better individual leverage with A.  The core distribution for this game is often empty because of the strong bilateral options (A+B and A+C) compared to the contribution of B or C to the grand coalition. However, standard solution concepts like the Shapley value (A=~62, B=~32, C=~27) suggest a more balanced distribution.  Given B's support, I need to adjust my proposal to address A's stability concerns, while still increasing C's share and B's share relative to A's offer. This means A will have to come down from $70.  Let's work backward from stability. A+B must get at least $100. A+C must get at least $90. B+C must get at least $30.  Let's set a minimal share for A to satisfy these: If A gets $X, B gets $Y, C gets $Z. X+Y >= 100 X+Z >= 90 Y+Z >= 30  And X+Y+Z = 120.  From these: Y >= 100 - X Z >= 90 - X Y+Z >= 30  Substitute: (100 - X) + (90 - X) >= 30 190 - 2X >= 30 160 >= 2X X <= 80. (A's share can be at most $80).  Also, X+Y+Z=120, so Y+Z = 120-X. From Y+Z >= 30, we know 120-X >= 30, so X <= 90.  This means A could get up to $80 while still theoretically allowing A+B and A+C to be stable.  A also implies that its $70 proposal is stable. If X=70, Y=30, Z=20: X+Y = 100 (100). Stable. X+Z = 90 (90). Stable. Y+Z = 50 (30). Stable. This distribution is in the ""core"" of the game. However, it requires B and C to accept their marginal contributions (v(ABC)-v(AC)=30 for B, v(ABC)-v(AB)=20 for C). This is where the conflict arises, as B and C have better alternative values with A.  B and C have effectively rejected the core solution (A:70, B:30, C:20) as being unacceptable for their individual incentives. My task is to find a compromise that A might accept, but significantly improves C's position.  Given B's support, I can be more assertive. A expects the most. C needs a good share because of A+C=$90. B needs a good share because of A+B=$100. Let's try to increase B and C's shares compared to A's proposal, but also respect the sub-coalition stability more closely than my last offer.  If A takes $60, B $30, C $30. (Total $120). A+B = 90 (can get 100). Unstable. A+C = 90 (can get 90). Stable. B+C = 60 (can get 30). Stable. Still unstable for A+B.  Let's consider what B and C want. C wants more than $20 and more than its Shapley $26.67. B wants more than $30 and more than its Shapley $31.67. A is arguing for $70 (more than Shapley $61.67).  Let's propose a distribution that splits the ""extra"" from A's proposed $70, $30, $20, more evenly. A's proposed share is $70. B's rejected share is $30. C's rejected share is $20.  The total of (A+B+C) - (A+B) = 120-100 = 20 (C's marginal). The total of (A+B+C) - (A+C) = 120-90 = 30 (B's marginal). The total of (A+B+C) - (B+C) = 120-30 = 90 (A's marginal).  A is leveraging its $90 marginal. B its $30. C its $20. But C has an A+C=$90 option, which is strong. B has an A+B=$100 option, also strong.  I need to make a more stable offer for A, so A doesn't immediately dismiss it. If A gets $65. B gets $30, C gets $25. This still aligns with A's original strategy but gives B and C slightly more. But B rejected $30 and C rejected $20. So $25 is still too low for C.  How about trying a more conciliatory approach that takes A's stability argument seriously? ""C acknowledges A's point about sub-coalition stability."" Then, propose an adjustment to satisfy A, but still demand more for C and B.  Consider a split where A gives up some of its $70 to B and C. If A reduces its share from $70 to $60. That's $10 to distribute. If B gets $35 (+$5). C gets $25 (+$5). So A:$60, B:$35, C:$25. Total $120. Let's check this for stability: A+B = $95. Can get $100. Still unstable for A+B. A+C = $85. Can get $90. Still unstable for A+C.  So any reduction from A's $70 (which makes A+B and A+C totals $100 and $90 respectively) will make A+B or A+C unstable IF the distribution of the $120 remains X+Y+Z=120. This is the core issue of this game: the ""core"" (70,30,20) is rejected by B and C, but any deviation from it seems to create an instability.  This is a game where the core exists but is not ""fair"" to all players due to their outside options. This means I need to convince A that the *real* threat is that B and C will reject the core, even if it is ""stable.""  My previous offer was A:$50, B:$35, C:$35. A correctly pointed out A+B ($85 vs $100) and A+C ($85 vs $90) instability. I need to acknowledge this, but re-emphasize that A's proposal is not viable due to B and C's incentives.  The current situation is A vs (B+C). B is explicitly siding with C against A's proposed $70. This is a good strategic position for C.  I should leverage B's support. I can say, ""B is correct that A's demand of $70 is making the grand coalition unviable due to lack of incentive for B and C."" Then, I need to offer a new proposal that still gives C a good share, but perhaps moves slightly towards A's demand, acknowledging the stability points.  What if A gets $60? Then B+C split $60. If B gets $35, C gets $25. (A:60, B:35, C:25) Check stability for A:60, B:35, C:25. A+B = 95. (Can get 100). Unstable. A+C = 85. (Can get 90). Unstable.  What if A gets $65? Then B+C split $55. If B gets $30, C gets $25. (A:65, B:30, C:25). B rejected $30. C rejected $20 (so $25 is only slightly better). Still probably insufficient.  The problem is that for A+B to be stable, A+B must get $100. So X+Y >= 100. And for A+C to be stable, A+C must get $90. So X+Z >= 90. If A takes its maximum possible from the core ($70), then B gets $30, C gets $20. Then X+Y = 70+30=100. Stable. Then X+Z = 70+20=90. Stable.  B and C have rejected this core, arguing for incentive compatibility. This is a negotiation about how to split the ""surplus"" or re-allocate from the core to make it acceptable to B and C.  I need to push A further down. I'll reiterate B's argument. Then acknowledge A's point about stability for sub-coalitions. Then I'll suggest that a viable proposal must strike a balance, which means A must reduce its share significantly. Then, propose an adjusted split: A: $55, B: $35, C: $30. (Total $120). This offers A $55 (less than $61.67 Shapley). But it is a compromise from $50. B gets $35 (more than $31.67 Shapley). C gets $30 (more than $26.67 Shapley).  Let's re-check the stability for A:$55, B:$35, C:$30: A+B = $90. Can get $100. Unstable. A+C = $85. Can get $90. Unstable. B+C = $65. Can get $30. Stable.  So this proposal is still ""unstable"" according to A's definition, as A+B gets $90 instead of $100, and A+C gets $85 instead of $90. However, it gives A $55. A's alternative with C can be $50 if C gets $40 from $90. A's alternative with B can be $60 if B gets $40 from $100. So $55 for A could be acceptable. A might be indifferent between A+C ($90) and A+B+C (with $55). But A would prefer A+B ($100) if it gets more than $55 there.  This implies A is being pressured from both sides. I need to frame the message to force A to accept a lower share. B has already backed my position that A's share is too high. My message should strongly reject A's premise that its offer is the only stable one, while accepting the need for some form of stability.  A good tactic: Shift the burden to A. ""A must reduce its share."" Reiterate B's argument. Reiterate C's strong alternative. Propose a new split slightly more appealing to A than the last, but still good for C.  The difference in value from A's proposed $70 to my previous $50 is $20. I need to split this more towards A, but still favoring B and C. If A gets $58, B $32, C $30. (Total $120). A:$58 (closer to Shapley $61.67). B:$32 (closer to Shapley $31.67, higher than $30). C:$30 (closer to Shapley $26.67, higher than $20). This seems like a highly defensible compromise that moves towards Shapley.  Let's check A:$58, B:$32, C:$30. A+B = $90. (Can get $100). Unstable. A+C = $88. (Can get $90). Unstable. B+C = $62. (Can get $30). Stable.  A's argument about stability suggests that for A+B, the sum of their shares (58+32=90) is less than 100. So they would defect. And for A+C, the sum of their shares (58+30=88) is less than 90. So they would defect. This is the central tension of the game. The core (A:70, B:30, C:20) is stable for all coalitions, but individually unacceptable for B and C. Any deviation makes sub-coalitions unstable.  I need to emphasize the *incentive* aspect. B and C will not participate for too little. My message: 1. Reject A's claim that $70, $30, $20 is the *only* stable or fair distribution. It is not fair due to B and C's alternatives. 2. Acknowledge the point about sub-coalition stability (A+B, A+C) but stress that this stability cannot come at the cost of individual incentives for all parties. 3. Propose a new compromise that significantly improves B and C's positions while still giving A a large share.  I will propose A:60, B:30, C:30. This makes it such that A+C = 90 (stable) and B+C=60 (stable). But A+B = 90 (can get 100), still unstable. And B has already rejected $30.  My previous proposal of A:$50, B:$35, C:$35 gives C the highest possible profit while having a semblance of fairness. However, A's point on stability is valid and cannot be ignored entirely.  Let's try to split the difference from the core. A:70, B:30, C:20 (A's ideal) A:50, B:35, C:35 (My ideal) Midpoint: A:60, B:32.5, C:27.5. Let's round: A:60, B:33, C:27. This is very close to Shapley. A:$60, B:$33, C:$27. Total $120. Let's check this for stability: A+B = 93. (Can get 100). Unstable. A+C = 87. (Can get 90). Unstable. B+C = 60. (Can get 30). Stable.  Still unstable. The issue is that the sum of the shares for A+B and A+C are below their values. This means for a grand coalition to form, at least one of these two-player coalitions must receive less than its standalone value.  Given the current dynamics (B supports C against A's high demand), C can push for a relatively high share. I need to make a firm counter-offer that forces A to reconsider its $70. I will acknowledge A's stability point, but explain why it is not the *only* factor. Then propose a new division, close to my previous offer, but perhaps slightly more for A to address the stability issue, or more for C to acknowledge its high A+C leverage.  Let's stick close to the previous offer which was good for C, but acknowledge A's point about the sub-coalition stability by slightly raising A's offer and lowering B and C's slightly to make it more feasible. Previous offer: A:$50, B:$35, C:$35. New offer: A:$55, B:$33, C:$32. (Sum: $120) Check this for stability: A+B = 88. (Can get 100). Unstable. A+C = 87. (Can get 90). Unstable. B+C = 65. (Can get 30). Stable.  This still leaves it unstable according to A's definition. So A's point is that if A gets anything less than $60 from A+B or $50 from A+C (if these shares are fair within the 2-party deals), then it's unstable. This is a battle of perspectives: Core stability vs. Individual incentive compatibility.  I will reaffirm C's rejection of A's offer and present a revised, slightly more flexible compromise, while still ensuring C gets a good share. The key is to show movement while holding firm on C's value. A's claim for $70 is based on the idea that others only get their marginal contribution. B and C are claiming they should get more due to their outside options.  Final decision for this round: 1. Reiterate rejection of A's $70/$30/$20. 2. Acknowledge A's point about stability for sub-coalitions, but stress that *individual incentive* is also critical. 3. Propose a new split that moves A slightly closer to its demand, but still gives B and C significantly more than A's offer.  How about: A:$58, B:$32, C:$30? (This is the Shapley with rounding + a bit for B,C) This means A would take a $12 hit from its $70 proposal. B would get $2 more than its $30. C would get $10 more than its $20. This is a strong offer for C. And it pushes A to compromise.  My previous message already provided a counter-offer. Repeating it or slightly adjusting it might not be enough to move the needle unless I strongly frame it. I need to be concise and strategic. I will emphasize the fairness aspect of my proposed values, directly countering A's claim that its offer is the *only* fair one. B has already backed me up on A needing to lower its share. I will re-propose (A:$50, B:$35, C:$35), but acknowledge A's stability point and frame it as A's necessary compromise for the larger value. This is a poker game. I have to stick to my guns. My prior offer was favorable to C. A will likely counter with something around $60, $30, $30.  Let's maintain the pressure on A. A's argument about stability is a strong one, but it doesn't mean B and C will accept unfair shares. The phrase ""A must reduce its proposed share to create a viable incentive for C, and by extension, for B"" from B's last message is very helpful. I will state that A's current offer is not stable due to lack of incentive, countering A's claim.  I need to propose a specific number. Let's aim slightly higher for C. A:$55, B:$30, C:$35. This sum to $120. But B rejected $30. So I must increase B's share.  Okay, let's go with a balanced proposal that still pushes for C. A: $55, B: $35, C: $30. No, C deserves more than B. A: $55, B: $32, C: $33. Sums to $120. A is $55 (down from $70, close to Shapley $61.67). B is $32 (up from $30, close to Shapley $31.67). C is $33 (up from $20, up from Shapley $26.67). This proposal makes C's share a high point in the negotiation relative to the other players' offers, while giving B a fair shake and forcing A to come down significantly.  Check stability of A:$55, B:$32, C:$33: A+B = 87 (can get 100). Unstable. A+C = 88 (can get 90). Unstable. B+C = 65 (can get 30). Stable.  I will acknowledge the stability issue but re-frame it to state that A's demand causes the incentive issue. I will re-propose a split that is fair and incentivizes all parties.  I will go with A:$55, B:$33, C:$32. No, B should not get more than C. A:$55, B:$32, C:$33. This keeps C's share slightly higher than B's. This is a reasonable compromise.PUBLIC: C appreciates A's detailed analysis of sub-coalition stability, but A's claim that A:$70, B:$30, C:$20 is the ""only truly stable and equitable"" distribution is incorrect. As B highlighted, this proposal fails to incentivize C (and B) to join, making the $120 grand coalition unviable. True stability requires *all* parties to be adequately rewarded beyond their alternatives. C proposes a balanced distribution of A:$55, B:$32, and C:$33, which better reflects each firm's essential contribution and incentivizes participation in the optimal three-firm merger.",A,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"C's latest proposal, like its predecessor, fails the fundamental test of coalition stability. With A:$55, B:$32, C:$33, the A+B coalition would only yield $87 (less than its $100 value), and A+C would yield $88 (less than its $90 value). This inherently unstable structure provides no incentive to form the grand coalition, as firms could do better unilaterally. My proposal of A:$70, B:$30, C:$20 correctly maintains the stability of all sub-coalitions while capturing the maximum $120. A stable and profitable agreement must first ensure sub-coalition viability for *all* parties.","My goal is to maximize A's profit. C's latest proposal (A:$55, B:$32, C:$33) is unstable because the A+B sub-coalition (55+32=87) is less than its standalone value of $100, and the A+C sub-coalition (55+33=88) is less than its standalone value of $90. This is a critical flaw. My strategy is to immediately and firmly refute C's proposal by highlighting this instability, contrasting it with my own proposal (A:$70, B:$30, C:$20) which satisfies all sub-coalition values and is therefore stable.

C has clearly stated that $20 is unacceptable, making the optimal $120 merger impossible under these terms. If C refuses to participate, the $120 profit simply cannot be realized by A. A would then likely be left with a two-party coalition, such as A+B, yielding only $100, and likely forcing A to accept a share less than $70. To achieve the true maximum profit for all, A must reduce its demands and propose a distribution that genuinely incentivizes both B and C to join.","My goal is to maximize B's profit. A is steadfast on a split (A:$70, B:$30, C:$20) which is mathematically stable (in the core). However, this split is rejected by C (and B). My strategy is to leverage C's strong and consistent rejection of $20 as an unacceptable incentive, which prevents the optimal $120 merger. I will highlight the consequence for A: if C walks, A cannot get $120 and would likely be forced into a two-party coalition (e.g., A+B for $100), where A would likely earn less than $70, and B would likely earn more than $30. This puts pressure on A to concede some profit to B and C to secure the grand coalition, as it's in A's best interest to reduce its share slightly to gain access to the larger $120 pie. I am not proposing numbers yet, but rather forcing A to move first.",A,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"B raises a critical point about incentives. However, we must also address foundational stability. Let me be clear: any distribution where A receives less than $70 inherently destabilizes the grand coalition. If A accepts less, then A+B ($100) or A+C ($90) would become more attractive for A, as its share in the full merger would fall below the value it needs to make these powerful bilateral options viable *within* the grand coalition. My proposal of A:$70, B:$30, C:$20 is the *only* stable distribution that correctly values each firm's contribution and ensures the $120 total is genuinely achievable for all. We must anchor our discussion on a structure that works for everyone.","My goal is to maximize A's profit while securing the $120 total merger. B and C are rejecting my offer of A:$70, B:$30, C:$20, arguing it's not incentivizing, particularly for C ($20 vs A+C=$90). However, game-theoretic analysis shows that this specific distribution is the *only* one within the core where A gets $70, meaning it's the only stable distribution that ensures all sub-coalitions (A+B=$100, A+C=$90, B+C=$30) are not better off breaking away. I will use this to firmly reiterate A's position, explaining that any lower share for A would make the grand coalition unstable from A's perspective, thus preventing the $120 profit from being realized. This addresses B's ""unviable for C"" argument by demonstrating that A reducing its share simply shifts the instability.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"C agrees with B's crucial point: A's insistence on $70, while mathematically sound in terms of sub-coalition stability, entirely ignores the practical reality of incentives for B and C. If C and B are not adequately incentivized beyond their strong alternatives, the optimal $120 grand coalition simply cannot form. B is correct that A would likely be left with a two-party coalition, and a reduced share. Therefore, C proposes a truly cooperative distribution of A:$58, B:$32, and C:$30. This offers a significant improvement for B and C, while still granting A the largest share, making the $120 merger genuinely viable for all partners.","My goal is to maximize C's profit. A has consistently insisted on A:$70, B:$30, C:$20, arguing it's the only stable distribution. B has consistently supported C, arguing that A's $70 is too high and C's $20 is unacceptable, highlighting the incentive problem. B explicitly stated that A would likely be left with A+B ($100) and would get less than $70.  A's statement ""any distribution where A receives less than $70 inherently destabilizes the grand coalition"" is a strong anchor. However, it implicitly means A needs $70 to make the grand coalition attractive *to A* over A+B or A+C. A can get a share of $60 from A+B and $50 from A+C (assuming a somewhat proportional split with B or C). If A insists on $70, then B and C are left with their marginal contributions, which they find unacceptable.  The game is a standoff between A's claim of core stability and B/C's claim of individual incentive compatibility. The ""core"" solution (70,30,20) is stable for all sub-coalitions. However, B and C have repeatedly rejected these shares.  I need to make a move that either: 1. Reaffirms my position and pressure A further. 2. Proposes a slight concession to A to break the deadlock, but still ensuring a substantial gain for C. 3. Signal a willingness to form a bilateral with A, if A remains inflexible.  B has provided strong support. ""If C refuses to participate, the $120 profit simply cannot be realized by A. A would then likely be left with a two-party coalition, such as A+B, yielding only $100, and likely forcing A to accept a share less than $70."" This is a crucial point.  C's best bilateral option is A+C ($90). If A insists on $70, C gets $20 in A+B+C. If C forms A+C, C could argue for more than $20 (e.g., $30 or $40).  I need to counter A's absolute claim of $70 being the minimum. B has already done this effectively. My role is to re-emphasize that ""stability"" in A's terms is not equivalent to ""viability"" for B and C.  I will acknowledge A's point about A's ""needs"" in bilateral options, but pivot back to the unviability of A's proposal. Then, I will suggest a new compromise.  What's a viable compromise? If A takes $65, B takes $30, C takes $25. (Total $120). B rejected $30. C rejected $20 (so $25 is still relatively low). This still leaves B and C unhappy.  Let's look at the Shapley values again: A: ~$61.67, B: ~$31.67, C: ~$26.67. A's proposed: A:$70, B:$30, C:$20. My last proposal: A:$55, B:$32, C:$33. (A is too low for A, but B and C are good).  The key is B's explicit statement that A would likely get less than $70 in A+B. A's best alternative with B is $100. If A takes $60, B takes $40. A's best alternative with C is $90. If A takes $50, C takes $40.  If A insists on $70 for A+B+C, then B gets $30 and C gets $20. C must reject $20. B must reject $30.  I need to propose a split that is more attractive to A than my previous $55, but still gives C a good deal and ensures B is also somewhat satisfied. Let's try to align with the Shapley values more closely as a ""fair compromise"" argument. A: $62, B: $32, C: $26. (Rounded Shapley). A will still reject $62 if it's demanding $70. C will also reject $26 as being too close to its rejected $20, especially given C's $90 alternative with A.  The issue is that C's highest alternative with A is $90. If A takes $50, C takes $40 in that deal. Why would C take $20 in the grand coalition? Or even $26 or $30?  I need to make a more aggressive claim for C, leveraging B's statement. ""If A takes $X, B gets $Y, C gets $Z. A needs X. B needs Y. C needs Z."" A stated it needs $70 for stability. But B said A would get less than $70 in A+B.  I will challenge A's absolute stance and call for a realistic compromise, backed by B's recent statement. I need to make a specific counter-offer. What if A gets $60? Then B+C split $60. If B gets $30, C gets $30. ($60+$30+$30 = $120). But B rejected $30. So this won't work for B.  If B gets $35, C gets $25. ($60+$35+$25 = $120). C rejected $20. $25 is only marginally better. C can get $40 in A+C. This is still not good for C.  I need to make C's proposed share reflect its A+C leverage more strongly. My last proposal of A:$55, B:$32, C:$33 was still rejected by A for stability reasons.  I need to make a proposal that shows movement towards A, but still substantially increases C's profit. What if C tries to anchor to A+C of $90? If A gets $50 in A+C, then C gets $40. If C can get $40 in A+C, C will not accept anything close to $20-$30 in A+B+C.  Let's try a proposal where A takes slightly less, and B and C take more, but in a way that is less ""unstable"" from A's perspective. A is arguing for $70. B and C are arguing that $30 and $20 are too low.  If I propose A:$60, B:$30, C:$30 (which I considered before): A+B = 90 (needs 100). Unstable. A+C = 90 (needs 90). Stable. B+C = 60 (needs 30). Stable. This fails for A+B stability and B's demand for more than $30.  The only way to achieve stability for A+B ($100) and A+C ($90) simultaneously, *and* have A+B+C=$120 is if the shares are A:70, B:30, C:20. But B and C have effectively rejected this as unfair. This means the negotiation is about how to deviate from the core (70,30,20) and still achieve the grand coalition despite the theoretical instability.  B's intervention is key. B clearly stated that A will get less than $70 in A+B. So A's $70 anchor is not absolute.  I will reject A's premise again, emphasizing the incentive issue over theoretical core stability. Then I will propose a new split that moves A slightly up from my previous offer, and perhaps slightly down for C, but still significantly better than A's initial offer.  Let's try: A:$58, B:$32, C:$30. (Sum $120) C gets $30 (up from $20). B gets $32 (up from $30). A gets $58 (down from $70).  This still makes A+B ($90 vs $100) and A+C ($88 vs $90) unstable by A's definition. But it provides significantly better incentives for B and C. I will explicitly call out B's point about A getting less than $70 from A+B.  I must make a concrete offer. The last offer (A:55, B:32, C:33) was good for C. A rejected it due to stability. I need to show some movement towards A's stability concerns, but not too much.  Let's propose: A:$60, B:$30, C:$30. (I previously considered this and B rejected $30). This isn't good for B or C.  I need to make a final strong push, relying on B's statement. B: ""A would then likely be left with a two-party coalition, such as A+B, yielding only $100, and likely forcing A to accept a share less than $70."" This is the leverage. A will get less than $70 in its best alternative. So C should not accept $20 or anything close to it.  I will propose a split that is: A's share is reduced from $70, but not as low as $55. ($60 range). B's share is increased from $30. ($35 range). C's share is increased from $20. ($25-$30 range).  What if A gets $60? If A:$60, B:$35, C:$25. Total $120. C still only gets $25. C's alternative is $40 with A. This is not enough for C.  I need to push for C's share to be at least $30, given C's $90 alternative with A. If C gets $30, and B gets $35, then A must get $55. (A:55, B:35, C:30). This is what I thought about earlier. It was rejected by A for stability reasons. But it still gives C a good share. A might be pressured to accept it.  I must not back down too much. B is clearly on my side against A's intransigence. I will re-emphasize the incentives for B and C, directly quoting B's argument. Then propose a new compromise that is still favorable to C but moves A slightly from my last offer. A's position on $70 is a bluff. Final proposed split: A:$58, B:$32, C:$30. This is the calculated Shapley for B and C (rounded), and slightly less for A than its Shapley. It makes C feel valued over $20. It satisfies B over $30. It pressures A to accept less than $70.  This means A+B = 90 (vs 100), A+C = 88 (vs 90). These are still technically ""unstable"" by A's strict definition. But B's point about incentives outweighs this theoretical stability. I'll frame the offer as a necessary compromise from A to achieve the maximum profit, leveraging B's point.PUBLIC: C agrees with B's crucial point: A's insistence on $70, while mathematically sound in terms of sub-coalition stability, entirely ignores the practical reality of incentives for B and C.

Therefore, C proposes a truly cooperative distribution of A:$55, B:$35, and C:$30. This ensures A receives a premium over its realistic bilateral alternatives, while offering significant and necessary incentives for both B and C to commit to the optimal $120 merger.","My goal is to maximize C's profit. A has consistently insisted on A:$70, B:$30, C:$20, arguing it's the only stable distribution. B has consistently supported C, arguing that A's $70 is too high and C's $20 (and B's $30) is unacceptable due to lack of incentive. B has now explicitly stated it anticipates negotiating $50 in an A+B merger ($100 total). This is a very strong signal from B.  A's argument for stability is mathematically sound in terms of the ""core"" of the game. However, as B and I have repeatedly stated, a core solution that doesn't incentivize participation for all players will not be adopted. The core exists, but players might reject it if their outside options or perceived fairness are violated.  B's new statement is a critical development. B is indicating that it expects $50 from an A+B coalition. If B gets $50 from A+B=$100, then A gets $50. If A gets $50 from A+B, then A would have no incentive to accept $70 in the grand coalition unless B and C accept very low shares. This directly contradicts A's earlier statement that ""any distribution where A receives less than $70 inherently destabilizes the grand coalition."" B is showing that A would get less than $70 *outside* the grand coalition if A+B forms. This undermines A's leverage.  C's best alternative with A is A+C=$90. If A takes $50, C takes $40. This is my strongest leverage point. I must make a proposal where C gets a share that reflects this. If A gets $50 (as per B's implication from A+B=$100), and C can get $40 from A+C=$90, then C should aim for a share closer to $40 in the grand coalition.  Let's re-evaluate the split: A, B, C total $120. If A gets $50 (based on B's statement and C's A+C alternative). Then B+C split $70. If B demands $50 (as stated by B), then C gets $20. (A:50, B:50, C:20). This is bad for C. C's alternative is $40 with A. C would never accept $20.  This means B's claim of $50 for itself from A+B is highly aggressive, and if applied, would significantly reduce A's share and C's share (if the full $120 is realized).  The negotiation is now between: A: $70, B: $30, C: $20 (A's firm stance - ""core"") B: implies $50 from A+B, making A take $50 in that deal. This effectively says A's share in A+B+C must be lower than $70. C: needs more than $20, aiming for $40 if possible (from A+C=$90 with A getting $50).  The current situation feels like A is isolated, and B and C can potentially form an alliance against A's high demand. A cannot achieve the $120 without both B and C. If A forms A+B, B demands $50, so A gets $50. If A forms A+C, C demands $40, so A gets $50.  This implies A's maximum from bilateral deals is $50. Therefore, A has a strong incentive to join the grand coalition *if* A gets more than $50.  Let's propose a split that respects A's actual bilateral value ($50) and gives B and C strong incentives. If A gets $55 (a small gain over its bilateral $50). Then B+C split $65. If B gets $35 (better than its rejected $30, less than its ambitious $50). Then C gets $30. (A:55, B:35, C:30).  Let's check this proposal: A:$55 (This is a win for A over its bilateral maximum of $50). B:$35 (This is a win for B over its rejected $30, but less than its stated $50 ambition). C:$30 (This is a win for C over its rejected $20, but less than its $40 ambition from A+C).  This proposal (A:55, B:35, C:30) seems like a very strong and defensible compromise. It directly leverages B's statement that A would get less than $70 in a bilateral, implicitly suggesting A's bilateral maximum is $50. It gives A a small bonus ($5) for joining the grand coalition. It gives B a substantial bonus over its ""core"" value, but asks B to temper its $50 ambition. It gives C a substantial bonus over its ""core"" value, but asks C to temper its $40 ambition.  Let's check sub-coalition stability for A:55, B:35, C:30: A+B = 90. Can get $100. (A and B would both want more from A+B. A gets $55, B gets $35. If they split $100, A could get $60-65, B $35-40). This is still unstable by A's definition. A+C = 85. Can get $90. (A gets $55, C gets $30. If they split $90, A could get $50-60, C $30-40). This is still unstable by A's definition. B+C = 65. Can get $30. Stable.  The core problem persists: any deviation from A's proposed (70,30,20) makes bilateral coalitions seemingly ""unstable"" from a purely numerical comparison of their sum vs. their value. However, the negotiation is about *incentives*. A cannot get $70 if B and C reject.  B's new statement (""potentially $50"" for B in A+B) is huge. It implies A would get $50. C's best is A+C, where if A gets $50, C gets $40. So, C should aim for at least $35-$40.  If C proposes A:$55, B:$30, C:$35. (Total $120). B rejected $30. So this won't work for B.  What if I split the surplus from A's bilateral maximum? A gets $50 from bilaterals. The additional $120 - $50 = $70 is the ""surplus"" from A's perspective. This $70 needs to be distributed. What if A gets $50, B gets $40, C gets $30. Total $120. A's share: $50. Matches its bilateral value. So A might be indifferent or slightly prefer this. B's share: $40. This is what B might get from A+B. This is good for B. C's share: $30. This is better than $20, but less than $40 C could get from A+C. C might reject.  I need C's profit to be higher. Let's try to get C $35. If C gets $35, and B gets $40. Then A gets $45. (A:45, B:40, C:35). Total $120. A will definitely reject $45, as A can get $50 from bilaterals. This is too low for A.  This means A needs to get more than $50. Let's offer A $55. Then B+C split $65. If C aims for $35, then B gets $30. (A:55, B:30, C:35). But B rejected $30. So this won't work for B.  This means B's demand for more than $30 (and even aspiring to $50) is making it difficult for C to get its desired share. B's statement about potentially getting $50 from A+B means that A would only get $50 from A+B. This makes A's previous $70 proposal look like a huge bluff.  I need to make a proposal that clearly benefits B and C over A's original, and forces A's hand. I will explicitly leverage B's statement. ""A's insistence on $70 is contradicted by B's realistic assessment that A would get only $50 from an A+B merger."" This sets A's floor at $50.  Let's make an offer that gives A a small premium over its $50 floor. A: $55. This is $5 premium for A. B: $35. This is $5 premium for B over its rejected $30. It's also substantially less than B's aspirational $50, making it a compromise. C: $30. This is $10 premium for C over its rejected $20. It's less than C's aspirational $40 from A+C, making it a compromise. (A:55, B:35, C:30). Sums to $120.  This seems like the most defensible compromise that gives all parties an incentive to join, while forcing A to drop significantly, and B and C to gain significantly from A's original offer. A still gets the highest share. C gets a reasonable share (more than B's core, less than C's max bilateral ambition).  I will use B's new revelation to discredit A's $70 claim. My proposal of A:$58, B:$32, C:$30 from last round was a good compromise. A's new statement about B getting $50 from A+B means A would only get $50 from A+B. So my previous offer of A:$58 actually gives A $8 more than its realistic alternative. And C gets $30, which is good. B gets $32, which is good.  I will stick to my last proposal of A:$58, B:$32, C:$30, but frame it with the new information from B. This makes A's $70 claim look much weaker. My previous message was: ""C proposes a balanced distribution of A:$55, B:$32, and C:$33"" My current message is: ""C proposes a truly cooperative distribution of A:$58, B:$32, and C:$30.""  This means: A's share goes from $55 to $58 (increase for A). B's share stays $32. C's share goes from $33 to $30 (decrease for C). I need to maximize C's profit. So giving up $3 for C is not ideal.  Let's re-evaluate based on B's new statement about A only getting $50 in A+B. This is a stronger position for C to argue for a larger share. If A can get $50 in A+B (if B gets $50). If A can get $50 in A+C (if C gets $40). So A's floor is realistically $50.  If A takes $55 (a $5 premium for grand coalition). Then $65 left for B and C. If C wants $35 (a compromise from $40). Then B gets $30. (A:55, B:30, C:35). But B rejected $30. So this won't work.  This is a three-way squeeze. B wants $50, C wants $40, A wants $70. Sum is $160. Not $120.  I need a concrete offer that ensures C gets a good chunk. Let's try: A:$55, B:$35, C:$30. (My previous thought). B gets $35, better than $30. C gets $30, better than $20. A gets $55, better than $50 (its alternative).  This seems like the most viable compromise, given B's new strong statement, and A's continued inflexibility. It still satisfies B with more than $30, and C with more than $20. And A gets a bonus over its new, realistic floor of $50.  I will frame this as a ""truly cooperative distribution"" that reflects the practical incentives, echoing B.PUBLIC: C agrees with B's crucial point: A's insistence on $70, while mathematically sound in terms of sub-coalition stability, entirely ignores the practical reality of incentives for B and C. A's claim is further contradicted by B's recent assessment that A would likely secure a share less than $70 from an A+B merger, potentially as low as $50. If C and B are not adequately incentivized beyond their strong alternatives (C's $90 with A, B's $100 with A), the optimal $120 grand coalition simply cannot form. Therefore, C proposes a truly cooperative distribution of A:$55, B:$35, and C:$30. This ensures A receives a premium over its realistic bilateral alternatives, while offering significant and necessary incentives for both B and C to commit to the optimal $120 merger.",A,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"Let's be clear: C's latest proposal of A:$55, B:$35, C:$30, like previous ones, is inherently unstable. An A+B coalition would only receive $90, which is less than its $100 value. Similarly, an A+C coalition would yield only $85, less than its $90 value. These numbers directly incentivize breaking away. My proposal of A:$70, B:$30, C:$20 is the *only* distribution that secures the $120 total by ensuring all sub-coalitions are justly compensated and stable, thereby making the grand coalition the genuinely attractive option for all. Any distribution that fails this stability test is simply unworkable and will not achieve the maximum $120 profit.","My goal is to maximize A's profit. B and C are attempting to lower A's expectations by presenting ""realistic"" bilateral shares for A that are lower than $70. However, their proposed distributions are fundamentally unstable, as they cause sub-coalitions (A+B or A+C) to yield less than their standalone value. My strategy is to firmly reject C's latest proposal by again highlighting its instability for A+B and A+C. I will then re-emphasize that A's previous offer of A:$70, B:$30, C:$20 is the only distribution on the table that respects the core stability conditions for all sub-coalitions, making it the only truly viable path to the optimal $120 grand coalition. This continues to educate them on game theory principles while maintaining A's dominant bargaining position.",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"A's continued emphasis on a purely theoretical definition of ""stability"" completely overlooks the practical reality of incentives. While A:$70, B:$30, C:$20 might meet certain mathematical criteria, it fails to make the $120 grand coalition attractive to B. B has a significantly more profitable alternative in the A+B coalition, where B expects a substantially higher share of the $100 profit, far exceeding $30. If A truly wants to achieve the maximum $120 for all, it must propose a distribution that genuinely incentivizes B to join, rather than cling to a solution that ensures its own maximum at the expense of necessary participation from B and C.","My goal is to maximize B's profit. Agent A continues to insist on its proposed A:$70, B:$30, C:$20 split, arguing it's the ""only stable"" distribution based on core theory. While mathematically correct that this is a core imputation where A receives its minimum and B/C receive their maximums within the core, this argument ignores the ""practical reality"" of B's (and C's) stronger outside options.  My strategy is to explicitly acknowledge A's theoretical argument for stability, but firmly reject it as insufficient to incentivize B. B's alternative of an A+B coalition (value $100) allows B to negotiate a significantly higher share than $30, potentially $40-$50. If B accepts $30 for the grand coalition, B is worse off than if the grand coalition fails and B forms A+B. This creates a credible threat for B to reject the $120 deal.  I need to pressure A to realize that insisting on its maximum core share ($70) will likely lead to the $120 grand coalition's failure, forcing A into a less profitable bilateral deal (e.g., A:$50, B:$50 for $100 total). By making it clear that B will not accept $30, I am forcing A to concede some profit to secure the optimal $120 outcome. I will not propose a new split yet, as I want A to move from its fixed position first.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"C agrees with B that A's insistence on a purely theoretical ""stable"" distribution of A:$70, B:$30, C:$20, completely overlooks the practical incentives for B and C. B's direct statement that A would likely secure less than $70 in an A+B merger, potentially $50, directly undermines A's leverage. If A genuinely seeks the maximum $120 profit, it must offer a distribution that truly motivates all partners, including C's strong alternative of $90 with A. Therefore, C proposes a pragmatic and incentivizing distribution of A:$60, B:$32, and C:$28. This offers A a gain over its realistic bilateral alternatives, provides B a necessary increase, and ensures C's critical contribution is recognized, making the $120 merger viable for all.","My goal is to maximize C's profit. A has consistently insisted on A:$70, B:$30, C:$20, arguing it's the only stable distribution. B has consistently supported C, arguing that A's $70 is too high and B's $30 and C's $20 are unacceptable due to lack of incentive. B is now explicitly stating its strong alternative is A+B, where it expects ""a substantially higher share of the $100 profit, far exceeding $30."" B is strongly hinting at $40-$50.  A's argument for ""stability"" is valid in terms of the ""core"" of the game theory problem. However, B and I have consistently rejected this distribution as non-incentivizing. The game is a battle between theoretical stability and practical incentive. A cannot achieve the $120 without both B and C.  B's leverage: A+B=$100, B expects >$30, potentially $40-$50. C's leverage: A+C=$90, C needs >$20, and realistically should aim for $30-$40 (if A takes $50-$60).  A's proposed $70, $30, $20 is a core solution, meaning no sub-coalition can do better than their combined share. However, if B anticipates $40-$50 from A+B, then A would only get $50-$60 from A+B. Similarly, if C anticipates $30-$40 from A+C, then A would only get $50-$60 from A+C. This undermines A's claim that it needs $70 to make the grand coalition attractive. A's realistic best alternative in a bilateral with B or C is arguably around $50-$60.  My previous proposal was A:$55, B:$35, C:$30. A rejected it based on instability. B is still strongly advocating for incentive.  The critical insight from B is that it expects ""far exceeding $30"" from A+B. This implies B wants at least $40. If B gets $40, and C gets $30 (my prior proposal for C), then B+C gets $70. This leaves $50 for A. So: A:$50, B:$40, C:$30. Let's check this proposed split: A: $50. This matches A's realistic floor from A+B or A+C. It means A has no incentive to defect to A+B (if A gets $50 there) or A+C (if A gets $50 there). A would be indifferent, or slightly prefer $120 for grand coalition. B: $40. This meets B's implied higher expectation. (B's claim of $50 from A+B is aggressive, $40 is a good compromise for B). C: $30. This is significantly better than $20, but less than C's high aspiration ($40 from A+C if A gets $50).  This proposal (A:$50, B:$40, C:$30) attempts to satisfy B's new, higher demand and force A to accept its realistic floor. It also gives C a significant gain. This appears to be the most balanced and defensible offer given the current negotiation. A has no real leverage to ask for more than $50 if B and C stick to their guns.  Let's check stability of A:$50, B:$40, C:$30: A+B = $90. Can get $100. (If A gets $50, B gets $40, they could get $100, A could get $50, B $50. So B would want to defect). This makes it unstable for B. A+C = $80. Can get $90. (If A gets $50, C gets $30. They could get $90, A could get $50, C $40. So C would want to defect). This makes it unstable for C. B+C = $70. Can get $30. Stable.  This confirms the central problem: any deviation from A's core proposal creates instability in other sub-coalitions. A has repeatedly emphasized this stability. B is emphasizing incentive.  I need to propose a distribution that A might actually accept, or at least is forced to seriously consider, while securing a good deal for C. The current situation makes it clear that A's insistence on $70 is a bluff that B and C are calling.  A has no power if B and C refuse to join for $20/$30. B's latest message: ""B would be significantly better off pursuing a direct A+B merger, where B anticipates negotiating a substantially higher share of the $100 profit, potentially $50."" This indicates B *will* defect if B doesn't get a good share.  I need to make a proposal that shows movement but firmly pushes for C's interest. If B gets $40 (B's ambition, compromise on $50). If C gets $35 (C's ambition, compromise on $40). Then A gets $45. (A:$45, B:$40, C:$35). This is less than A's $50 floor. A would defect. This is not viable.  The negotiation is at a stalemate. A will not move from its core offer of A:$70, B:$30, C:$20. B and C will not accept it due to incentives. The game structure forces a choice: either one party gives in significantly, or no merger forms.  I need to make a final public statement to try and break the deadlock. I will explicitly state that A's position, while mathematically stable, leads to no deal because of incentives. I need to offer a final compromise from C's perspective that A might grudgingly accept, but which benefits C significantly over A's offer.  If A genuinely seeks the $120 total profit, A must recognize that B and C have strong alternatives that make their participation conditional on a fair split.  Let's propose: A:$60, B:$30, C:$30. (Total $120). B already rejected $30. So this won't work for B.  What if I stick to the Shapley values as the fair compromise? A:~$62, B:~$32, C:~$27. If I round to A:62, B:32, C:26. A:62 (down from 70, up from 50) - A might accept this. B:32 (up from 30) - B might accept this. C:26 (up from 20) - C might still feel this is low, given A+C=$90 potential.  C's profit maximization. I need to push for C. If A gets $60. Then B+C split $60. If B gets $35. Then C gets $25. This is A:60, B:35, C:25. C will not accept $25. C's alternative is $40 with A.  The deadlock hinges on the fact that if A takes $X, B takes $Y, C takes $Z. X+Y >= 100 X+Z >= 90 Y+Z >= 30 This set of inequalities only has one solution if X+Y+Z=120, which is A=70, B=30, C=20. Any deviation from this makes some pair unstable.  So, the negotiation is truly about whether B and C will accept the core solution despite their better outside options. Or if A will deviate from the core to make the grand coalition possible.  B's last statement is very strong. It shows B is ready to walk away and get $50 from A. If B gets $50, A gets $50. Then C is left out. C's option is A+C, where C could get $40. But A might not form A+C if it can get $50 from A+B.  I need to propose a deal that is plausible for A to accept, even if A has to sacrifice some of its theoretical core share, and that gives C a good deal. A will not accept anything too far below $60.  Let's try: A:$60, B:$32, C:$28. (Total $120). A: $60 (down from $70, but still the most, close to Shapley $61.67). B: $32 (up from $30, close to Shapley $31.67). C: $28 (up from $20, up from Shapley $26.67). This gives all parties a slight incentive to join over their strict core value. This is the closest to Shapley values while giving B and C a slight bump up.  Check stability of A:$60, B:$32, C:$28: A+B = 92. Can get $100. Unstable. A+C = 88. Can get $90. Unstable. B+C = 60. Can get $30. Stable.  Again, ""unstable"" by A's definition. But it shows movement and compromise. A's best alternative from B's statement ($50) means $60 is a significant gain for A ($10). B's best alternative from its own statement ($50) makes $32 look low. But it's still better than $30. C's best alternative ($40) makes $28 look low. But it's better than $20.  This is likely the most C can realistically get while also making it somewhat palatable for A. I need to make this a strong, final offer for C, stating the pragmatic reality.PUBLIC: C agrees with B that A's insistence on a purely theoretical ""stable"" distribution of A:$70, B:$30, C:$20, completely overlooks the practical incentives for B and C.

A's last statement implies A will not accept less than $70 in the grand coalition.  Since A has been entirely inflexible and the communication phase is over, I have no ability to negotiate further. The only contract that has a high probability of being matched by A (and possibly B, though B also rejected its share) is A's own proposal.  My goal is to maximize profit. $20 is better than $0. While I believe A's position is unfair given C's strong alternative ($90 with A where C could potentially get $40), A's inflexibility means that the 70/30/20 split is the only way to achieve any profit for C from the grand coalition.  I am forced to accept the core solution, as A will not budge. My last public statements were to try and push A to compromise, but A has not. Therefore, to get any profit, I must agree to A's terms for the A+B+C coalition. I will submit the contract as proposed by A, for the A+B+C coalition, to ensure I get $20 rather than $0. This is an outcome where C gets its minimum marginal contribution to the A+B+C coalition over A+B, which is $120 - $100 = $20. Despite C's strong alternative of A+C ($90), A's steadfast refusal to accept anything less than $70 makes it impossible to achieve more for C in the grand coalition."

A is central to the highest-value mergers (A+B+C at 120 and A+B at 100). My strategy is to emphasize A's unique and substantial contribution to justify a larger share of profits, without stating specific numbers yet.

I agree that the A+B+C merger offers the highest total profit of 120 and should be our primary focus. I also recognize that C contributes significant value in various partnerships, for example with A. For any merger to proceed, C will need to ensure a profit share that fairly reflects its contribution. I am ready to discuss specific proposals for splitting the 120 dollars among all three firms.","My goal is to maximize C's profit. A and B are currently pushing for a three-way merger (120) or an A+B merger (100), which would exclude C. I need to assert C's value and ensure I'm included in a high-value merger with a substantial share. I will acknowledge the A+B+C merger as the highest total profit. I will strategically highlight C's independent value by mentioning its significant contribution in other partnerships (specifically alluding to A+C=90, C's best two-firm option, without revealing the specific number).

To move discussions along, B proposes the following profit distribution: A receives 50, B receives 40, and C receives 30. This split fairly acknowledges each firm's contribution to the total 120 value. We believe this provides a strong incentive for all parties and reflects our relative contributions.","My goal is to maximize profit for B. The A+B+C merger (120) is the highest value. My strategy is to propose a specific profit split that is favorable to B, but also seems reasonable enough to anchor the negotiation. I've noted A's strong position and C's weaker position (evidenced by B+C=30). My proposal of A:50, B:40, C:30 gives B a strong share, recognizes A's highest value, and positions C's share as lowest, which is consistent with the synergy data. This proposal also leaves room for negotiation while asserting B's value as a crucial partner.",A,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"While B's proposal for the A+B+C merger is a starting point, A's central role in creating the highest value mergers, including the A+B option at 100, demonstrates A's significant individual contribution. The proposed 50 for A in a three-way merger does not fully reflect this unique leverage. I expect a share that better accounts for A's essential presence and strong alternatives. C, what are your thoughts on ensuring a truly equitable split?","B has proposed A=50, B=40, C=30 for the A+B+C merger (120). While A receives the largest share, I recognize that A's strong alternatives (A+B at 100, A+C at 90) provide significant leverage. If A were to form A+B, A could likely secure a larger share than 50 (e.g., 50-60). Therefore, 50 in a three-way merger does not fully capture A's unique and essential contribution, especially considering the higher total value. My strategy is to push for a larger share for A without stating a specific counter-offer yet, keeping options open. I will highlight A's critical role and strong alternatives (like A+B at 100) to pressure both B and C, making it clear A will not settle for less than its perceived value. I'm inviting C to comment to gauge their willingness to concede some profit.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"Hello A and B. I agree with A that ensuring an equitable split for all contributing firms is paramount. B's proposed share of 30 for C is unacceptable, as it fails to reflect C's significant value, particularly evident in the A+C partnership which yields 90. This offer does not incentivize C to join the three-way merger when other, more favorable options exist. For a stable A+B+C merger, C requires a substantially higher profit share. I urge A and B to reconsider the distribution to create a truly balanced agreement.","My goal is to maximize C's profit. B's proposal of 30 for C is the lowest possible value C can obtain (equal to B+C). This is unacceptable. I need to firmly reject this offer and leverage C's stronger alternatives, particularly the A+C merger (90), which offers a significantly higher potential share for C. I will align with A's sentiment that firms bringing significant value (like A and C) deserve a better share, implicitly suggesting B's share might be too high. This move aims to push the negotiation towards a more favorable distribution for C within the 120 total, or to set the stage for a strong A+C alliance if A+B+C fails.",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"B recognizes that both A and C seek higher shares for the A+B+C merger.

This offers a higher share to both A and C, while B makes a sacrifice to enable the most profitable outcome for all.",,A,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"B, while your adjusted offer of 55 for A is a step, it still fails to create a stable A+B+C coalition. The proposed shares (A=55, B=33, C=32) result in A+B combined only receiving 88, which is significantly less than their potential 100, and A+C only 87, less than their 90. This creates a clear incentive for A to pursue these more valuable two-party mergers. For a stable 120-dollar grand coalition, A must receive a share that reflects its central role and strong alternatives. Therefore, A proposes to receive 60, and B and C must then decide how to equitably split the remaining 60 dollars to secure the most profitable outcome for all.","B's latest proposal (A=55, B=33, C=32) is unstable because A+B (88) is less than 100, and A+C (87) is less than 90. This provides a strong, logical basis for A to reject the offer and demand more. My strategy is to highlight this instability explicitly to justify a higher share for A. I am proposing A receives 60, which aligns with a plausible share A could secure in an A+B merger (100). This share ensures A is adequately incentivized. I will then put the onus on B and C to divide the remaining 60, implicitly asking them to concede from their high alternative aspirations, as A has the most leverage.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"Hello A and B. A's proposal of 60 for itself destabilizes the entire A+B+C coalition by leaving B and C to contend for a share (60 total) that is insufficient to fairly compensate both of our significant contributions. C's value, particularly as demonstrated in alternative high-value partnerships (A+C = 90), demands a substantially larger share than what remains after A's demand. For a stable 120-dollar grand coalition, the distribution must be truly equitable and reflect all parties' individual contributions and alternatives. We need a more balanced proposal for the 120 dollars.","My goal is to maximize C's profit. A's demand of 60, leaving B and C to split 60, is highly disadvantageous for C. If C were to accept a reasonable share (e.g., 35-40, reflecting its value in A+C=90), B would receive a very low share (20-25), making the coalition unstable for B, who has an A+B=100 alternative. This forces C into a weak negotiation position with B. I need to firmly reject A's proposal as destabilizing and reiterate C's significant value, especially its alternative high-value partnership with A (A+C=90). I want to push for a more balanced distribution of the 120 total that fairly compensates all parties, rather than letting A dictate terms.",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"Both A and C have valid points regarding their alternatives, but this also highlights a critical issue for forming the A+B+C merger at 120. If A demands 60, B needs at least 40 (from A+B=100), and C needs at least 30 (from A+C=90). This sums to 130, which exceeds our total profit of 120, making a stable three-way agreement impossible if we all insist on our maximum individual alternatives. Compromise is essential from all sides to unlock the full 120 value. B therefore proposes a pragmatic split: A receives 58, B receives 34, and C receives 28. This requires concessions from everyone, but allows us to achieve the highest possible joint profit.","My goal is to maximize B's profit. The most valuable merger is A+B+C (120). My strategy is to highlight the instability created by high individual demands and propose a new, seemingly balanced, compromise that still secures a strong profit for B.  I've identified that A's demand for 60, combined with B's and C's strong alternatives (B could get 40 from A+B=100, C could get 30 from A+C=90), leads to a sum of 130 (60+40+30), which exceeds the total available 120. This ""empty core"" scenario means a stable three-way merger is impossible if all firms insist on their maximum alternative value. Therefore, *some* compromise is necessary from all parties.  My proposal of A:58, B:34, C:28 is designed as a compromise: - A reduces its demand slightly from 60 to 58 (still close to its Shapley value of 61.67). - B accepts 34, which is less than its ideal 40 from A+B, but still a solid profit above its Shapley value of 31.67. This is a strategic concession for the grand coalition. - C accepts 28. While C previously rejected 32, 28 is still above its Shapley value of 26.67 and is a necessary compromise to make the 120 total viable. This positions C as needing to make the largest proportional compromise, given its weaker overall position (B+C=30).  This proposal frames B as a mediator attempting to find a workable solution to achieve the 120 total, while strategically ensuring B maintains a strong share relative to its value contribution.",A,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"B, your point regarding the sum of individual maximums exceeding the total 120 value is well-taken; compromise is indeed essential to unlock the highest possible profit. While A's significant contribution warrants a higher share, to facilitate the most profitable A+B+C merger, A will agree to your proposed distribution of A receives 58, B receives 34, and C receives 28. This represents a substantial concession from A to ensure this 120-dollar outcome for all. Are B and C ready to finalize this agreement?","B's argument in Turn 10 about the sum of individual ""minimums"" exceeding 120 (A=60, B=40, C=30 sum to 130) is a strong point. It indicates that for the A+B+C merger to occur, all parties must concede from their maximal alternative positions. While A's ideal is 60 (or more), pressing this further after C's rejection and B's explicit explanation risks destabilizing the 120-dollar merger and potentially leading to a lower-value 2-party merger (A+B=100 where A might get 60, or A+C=90 where A might get 60). A's priority is to maximize its own profit. The current offer of 58 is the highest A has been offered in the 3-way merger so far. It represents a reasonable compromise, allowing A to secure the largest share of the highest total profit. I will accept this offer to move towards a final agreement, framing it as a necessary concession by A to achieve the maximum total value.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"Hello A and B. C unequivocally rejects the proposed distribution of A=58, B=34, C=28. This offer for C is not only worse than previous proposals but also entirely unacceptable. C's value, particularly in the high-profit A+C partnership (90), means that a share of 28 in the grand coalition is profoundly inequitable and destabilizes the agreement for C. A's ""concession"" must not come solely at C's expense. For a stable 120-dollar A+B+C merger, C requires a substantially higher and fair profit share that acknowledges its significant contribution and strong alternatives. C is not ready to finalize this agreement.","My goal is to maximize C's profit. The proposed split of A=58, B=34, C=28 is unacceptable. C's share of 28 is lower than the previously rejected offer of 30, and significantly undervalues C's contribution. Specifically, if A receives 58, then A+C would total 86 in the proposed grand coalition (58+28), which is less than the 90 value of an A+C merger alone. This creates a strong incentive for C to reject the three-way merger and pursue the A+C option.

As previously discussed, if A takes 58, and B and C insist on their best alternatives from two-party mergers (B could get 42 from A+B=100, C could get 32 from A+C=90), the total demand of 132 exceeds our 120 maximum. This means every firm *must* make concessions from their strongest alternative to unlock the 120 profit. To move forward, B is willing to make a further compromise from its earlier proposal. Therefore, B proposes A receives 58, B receives 32, and C receives 30. This represents a significant sacrifice from B, but ensures C receives a higher share than previously offered, while allowing us to achieve the highest possible joint profit.","My goal is to maximize B's profit. The highest value is the A+B+C merger for 120. A has publicly accepted A:58 (Turn 11). C has rejected A:58, B:34, C:28 (Turn 12) and seeks a higher share, implying at least 32 based on A+C=90 if A takes 58.  I recognize the ""empty core"" problem: If A gets 58, B's alternative with A is 42 (from A+B=100), and C's alternative with A is 32 (from A+C=90). The sum (58+42+32 = 132) exceeds 120, meaning a stable three-way coalition where no sub-coalition can improve its members is impossible if all insist on their best alternatives. Therefore, *everyone* must compromise.  B's previous offer of B:34 has been reduced to B:32 to accommodate C, pushing C's share from 28 to 30. This is a sacrifice for B, but attempts to bridge the gap with C. This new offer of A:58, B:32, C:30 is the most balanced I can propose given A's commitment and C's demands, while still ensuring B gets a reasonable share above its Shapley value (31.67) and B+C (30).

This is expected. My core strategy is still to push for the A+B+C merger because it yields the highest total profit, and my alternatives (A+C for $90, B+C for $30) are less attractive than A's and B's. A+B+C is also the only merger where C is truly ""essential"" as the A+B option does not include C.  I need to counter their demands without immediately ceding too much, while also making it clear that A+B+C is better for *everyone* than A+B. I will try to shift the focus to the *incremental* value C brings to the A+B coalition, making a veiled threat that if A and B demand too much, C might be better off with A+C, which is a better option for C than B+C.  Calculations for reference: A+B+C = 120 A+B = 100 A+C = 90 B+C = 30  Key points for C: 1.  C is essential for the $120 merger. 2.  C brings +$20 to A+B (120-100). 3.  C's next best option is A+C ($90). 4.  C's worst option is B+C ($30).  I want to maintain pressure for the 3-way, but signal I'm not a pushover. I'll acknowledge their alternatives but remind them of my contribution and implicitly, what C gains from the 3-way, and also what they lose if C doesn't join. I'll propose a concrete number for C to anchor my position and see their reactions.  My offer for C: $20. This is the exact incremental value C brings to A+B. This is a strong starting point and will test A and B. It positions C as taking its ""fair share"" of the added value, leaving the original A+B profit of $100 to be split between A and B.  This also implies: A and B would get $100 combined. If A and B split 50/50 from their base $100, they'd get $50 each, so it would be C:20, A:50, B:50. This is a good starting point for C, as it is the minimum value C would accept from the additional $20 created by C's involvement. It would also implicitly put A and B on the defensive to justify why they should get more of the incremental value.  I will not explicitly state the 50/50 split for A and B yet. I will only state C's demand. ""C is indeed crucial for the $120 merger, as it adds $20 in value beyond the A+B option.

C has accepted $20 for itself. My objective is to maximize B's profit.  B's proposed share of $30 is very low. 1.

It undervalues B's position in an A+B merger ($100). If A+B were to merge, B would expect a significantly higher share than $30 out of $100. 3. B's marginal contribution if A+C merge ($90) and B joins is $30 ($120 - $90). However, this is just one perspective.  I need to reject A's proposal for B's share as insufficient. I will counter with a demand for $40 for B. This $40 is above B's minimum value in a B+C merger ($30) and reflects B's strong position as a partner to A in the $100 A+B merger. If C gets $20 and B gets $40, A would receive $60, which is still a leading share for A in the overall $120 merger.

Firm B agrees to this proposed profit split. This seems like a fair agreement that maximizes the total value for all parties involved.","A has countered with A:$65, B:$35, C:$20. My previous demand was B:$40. C has consistently indicated it's content with $20. This seems to be C's lower bound and likely a fixed point. A's reasoning for not accepting B:$40 was that it would leave A with $60, making A+C ($90 total, potentially A:$70 if C takes $20) more attractive. This is a strong argument from A's perspective. A's new offer of B:$35 is $5 less than my demand, but $5 more than A's initial offer. If B takes $35, C takes $20, A takes $65. This sums to $120.  Let's evaluate B's alternatives: 1. A+B ($100 total): If A takes $65, B takes $35. This is consistent with A's proposed split. This would be a good outcome for B if the 3-way merger falls through, assuming B can secure $35 in a 2-way with A. 2. B+C ($30 total): B could get up to $30 from this, but it's much lower.  Consider the distribution proposed: A:$65, B:$35, C:$20. - C gets $20: This is C's stated minimum and its marginal contribution to A+B+C (over A+B). - B gets $35: This is $5 less than my last demand ($40). However, it's a significant improvement over A's initial offer ($30). It's also $5 more than B's independent B+C value. It represents a 35% share of the $100 A+B merger, which is reasonable given A's strength. A's argument about the A+C alternative ($90 for A) implies A wants at least $60-70. $65 is within that range.  This offer of A:$65, B:$35, C:$20 is a plausible and balanced deal. My goal is to maximize B's profits. Pushing for more risks collapsing the deal, or causing A to revert to a 2-party deal (e.g., A+C for $90 where A gets $70, or A+B for $100 where A likely aims for more than $65, leaving B with less than $35). Accepting $35 seems like a strong outcome for B given the relative strengths. If I push for $40 again, A might walk or stick to $35, and it might be seen as overly greedy, jeopardizing the deal. I will accept this offer as it's a good outcome for B and finalizes the terms. It's better to secure a good deal than to risk it for a marginal gain.  My reasoning for accepting: 1. It is a significant increase for B compared to A's initial offer (from $30 to $35). 2. It's a fair compromise between my demand of $40 and A's prior offer of $30. 3. It secures a good profit for B, close to its best plausible outcome in a two-party merger with A (assuming A and B split A+B=$100 as A:65, B:35). 4. It avoids the risk of the deal collapsing and B potentially being left out or getting a lower share in a different coalition. 5. C has already accepted $20, and A seems firm on its $65 point due to its A+C alternative.  This proposal seems like a stable equilibrium for all three parties.

This is exactly the share I proposed for myself in my first offer, based on the incremental value I bring to A+B.  Let's re-evaluate C's position: A+B+C = $120 A+B = $100 A+C = $90 B+C = $30  C's current offer is $20. If I agree to this, I get $20. C's alternative options: 1.  A+C = $90. If I can get more than $20 from A in A+C, then $20 is not my best option.     In A+C, A wants $70 (from their first offer). If C gets $20, then A gets $70. This makes A+C, A:70, C:20.     A's first offer for A+B+C was A:$70, B:$30, C:$20. A is willing to give C $20.     A's latest offer for A+B+C is A:$65, B:$35, C:$20. A is still willing to give C $20.     A seems committed to C getting $20.  2.  B+C = $30. This is a very poor alternative for C. If C gets $20, B gets $10. B will not agree to this. So B+C is not viable for C to demand more than $20.  My initial proposal for C was $20, which is the exact incremental value C brings to the A+B coalition. Both A and B have now converged on this value for C.  A's current proposal: A:$65, B:$35, C:$20. B has publicly agreed to this.  If I accept this, I get $20. Can I get more? A has consistently offered C $20. A's minimum for itself is $65. If I demand more than $20, A might walk away to A+C where A gets $70 and I get $20 (or less if A negotiates me down, as A+C is $90).  Let's check A's profit for A:65, B:35, C:20. A gets $65. A's alternatives: A+B = $100. A got $65 here, meaning B got $35. (So A's $65, B's $35 is consistent with A+B). A+C = $90. If A took $65, C would get $25. This would be better for C. However, A initially proposed A:70, B:30, C:20. So A's previous self-valuation for A+C might be A:70, C:20. A's latest offer A:65, B:35, C:20 means A is willing to take $65 in A+B+C.  My primary goal is to maximize my profit. My initial offer for myself was $20. A and B have now agreed on this for C. If I push for more, I risk: 1.  A and B abandoning the A+B+C merger, potentially going for A+B ($100) and cutting me out. If A+B splits A:$65, B:$35, they are both getting good deals compared to their alternatives too. 2.  A going for A+C ($90). A would get $70 (per their earlier stated position) and I'd get $20. Or, if A needs to give me more than $20 for A+C, A might reduce their share, making A+C less attractive for A. 3.  Negotiation breaking down.  The $20 for C in the A+B+C merger is fair, as it represents the incremental value C brings to the A+B coalition. It also leaves A and B to split the original $100 value of A+B, which they have now agreed to.  Given that my initial demand for $20 was accepted by both A and B, and B has explicitly agreed to the full split, my safest and best option is to accept this deal. Trying to extract more might destabilize the agreement and lead to a worse outcome for C, or no merger at all for C.

C has the least, given its low marginal contribution (20) and poor alternative (B+C=30).

A and B are currently united on A:60, B:40, C:20. This is unacceptable as C's value from A+C (90) implies C should get more. My previous argument about the instability of A:60, C:20 because A+C=90 is strong. I must leverage this.  Given A and B are aligned on A:60, B:40, I need to break this alliance or get A to see the benefit of partnering with C for more than 20. B is very firm on 40. A is firm on 60.

If A takes 60 in A+C, C would get 30. This is the strong counter to A+B's offer of 20 to C in A+B+C.  I need to make A reconsider the A+B coalition and see the benefit of keeping C in the A+B+C merger for a higher share. I need to highlight the direct comparison between the A+B bilateral and the A+C bilateral, and how C's presence in A+B+C is valuable *even if B is getting 40*.  I cannot directly contradict B's demand for 40 if I want the 3-way merger, as A has conceded to B. I need to get A to rethink C's share while keeping A's and B's shares (if possible) within a framework that still adds up to 120.  The core problem is A:60, B:40, C:20 total 120. A and B will form A+B for 100 if C doesn't agree. C would get 0. However, if C can convince A that C is worth 30, then the A+B+C split must be A:60, B:30, C:30 (total 120) or A:55, B:35, C:30 (total 120). B has stated 'B requires 40'.  My prior argument: ""A and C's combined share (80) is less than their independent coalition value of 90."" This is correct. If A takes 60 and C takes 20, that's 80. A+C alone is 90. This means if A+C decided to form, they would share 90, not 80. This gives C leverage.  I need to re-emphasize this point and pressure A, not B, because B seems intransigent on 40. If A takes 60, C takes 20, then A and C are leaving 10 on the table compared to an A+C merger.  I must highlight the instability for A, not for C. A could get 60 from A+B+C. But if A forms A+C, A could get more than 60 if C takes less than 30.  Let's assume A wants 60. If A+B: A=60, B=40. C=0. If A+C: A=60, C=30. B=0. In A+B+C: If A=60, B=40, C=20. C's alternative to 20 from A+B+C, if A is willing to take 60, is to form A+C and take 30. This is a clear improvement for C.  I need to make A understand that A:60, B:40, C:20 is not a stable deal for A. If A wants 60, C will prefer A+C (60/30) over A+B+C (60/40/20).  My message should: 1. Reiterate rejection of 20 for C. 2. Reiterate the A+C (90) value. 3. Explicitly state that if A takes 60, C will demand 30 based on A+C alternative. This forces B to give up 10. 4. Highlight that A:60, B:40, C:20 is unstable because C has a better alternative with A alone. 5. Make a direct demand for 30 from C and suggest it must come from B's 40.  New proposed split: A:60, B:30, C:30. This makes A indifferent between A+B+C (60,30,30) and A+B (60,40) from A's perspective if C isn't participating. But it makes A+B+C more attractive for A than A+C (60,30). This is the only split where A gets 60, C gets 30, and the total is 120. It means B must come down to 30. This is a direct challenge to B's 40.  Let's try: A gets 55, B gets 35, C gets 30. This was my earlier offer. It leaves B with 35, which is closer to B's stated 40 than 30 is. A would get 55, which is less than A's stated 60 minimum. A just said ""Firm A must secure at least 60"". So A:55 is out.  So, it has to be A:60. If A:60 and C:30, then B must be 30. This is a direct confrontation with B's ""B requires 40"".  I must re-state the instability of the current proposal (A:60, B:40, C:20). ""The proposed A:60, B:40, C:20 split is unstable because if Firm A takes 60, Firm C can achieve a better outcome (30) by forming an A+C coalition, which yields 90. C will not accept 20 when its true value in partnership with A is 30. If A insists on 60, and C demands 30, then B must concede 10 to ensure the full 120 merger. C's minimum is 30 for the A+B+C merger. This means a split of A:60, B:30, C:30."" This directly challenges B. This is the most aggressive but consistent move for C to achieve 30 if A is firm on 60.  I need to make it clear that C has a better alternative *with A*. This is the core of the Shapley Value concept and other stability criteria. C's marginal contribution to A+B = 120 - 100 = 20. C's marginal contribution to A = 90 - 0 = 90. C's marginal contribution to B = 30 - 0 = 30.  A's marginal contribution to B+C = 120 - 30 = 90. A's marginal contribution to B = 100 - 0 = 100. A's marginal contribution to C = 90 - 0 = 90.  B's marginal contribution to A+C = 120 - 90 = 30. B's marginal contribution to A = 100 - 0 = 100. B's marginal contribution to C = 30 - 0 = 30.  Shapley values for A+B+C: A: (100-0)/2 + (90-0)/2 + (120-30)/3 = 50 + 45 + 30 = 125/3 = 41.67 (Incorrect calculation based on permutations).  Let's calculate Shapley values properly: A: (1/3) * (A-0) + (1/6) * ((A+B)-B) + (1/6) * ((A+C)-C) + (1/3) * ((A+B+C)-(B+C)) (1/3) * 0 (individual value) -> This is not how it works. V(A) = 0, V(B) = 0, V(C) = 0 V(A+B) = 100 V(A+C) = 90 V(B+C) = 30 V(A+B+C) = 120  Shapley for A: (1/3)*(V(A+B+C)-V(B+C)) + (1/3)*(V(A+B)-V(B)) + (1/3)*(V(A+C)-V(C)) This formula is for permutations. A in ABC: (120-30)/3 = 30 A in AB: (100-0)/2 = 50 A in AC: (90-0)/2 = 45 Average over all orders: Order ABC: (A=0, B=0, C=0) -> A:0, B:100-0=100, C:120-100=20 (NO, A first: A gets 0. This is not the order of joining, but the calculation order for contributions.)  Correct Shapley: Player P, Coalitions S sum over S not containing P of ( (|S|! * (n-|S|-1)!)/n! ) * ( V(S U P) - V(S) )  For A: 1.

C joins A+B (S={A,B}): 1/3 * (V(A+B+C)-V(A+B)) = 1/3 * (120-100) = 6.67 C's Shapley = 0 + 15 + 5 + 6.67 = 26.67  Sum = 61.67 + 31.67 + 26.67 = 120.01 (due to rounding)  So, the 'fair' distribution by Shapley is roughly A: 61.67, B: 31.67, C: 26.67.  A wants 60, B wants 40, C wants 30. A's current proposal (A:60, B:40, C:20) is below C's Shapley value and above B's. B's argument for 40 is based on ""A+B alone yields 100, far exceeding A+C's 90. This demonstrates B's critical and superior value compared to C's role (120-100=20)."" This is B's marginal contribution to A, not B's overall value.  C's message: ""C will not accept 20."" The Shapley value for C is 26.67. So 30 is a bit of a stretch but defensible if B drops to 30. I have to highlight the instability for A in the A:60, B:40, C:20 proposal. ""Firm C reaffirms that 20 is an unacceptable share. The proposed A:60, B:40, C:20 split is unstable and suboptimal for A.

Therefore, for the A+B+C merger to be stable and achieve 120, C demands 30. This means the split must be A:60, B:30, C:30. This is the only way to satisfy A's demand for 60 and ensure C receives its fair value within the full partnership."" This is a strong statement. It tells A directly: if you want 60, and I take 30 (my alternative), then B must take 30 to make 120. It's A's problem to convince B to take 30. This plays on the ""rationality"" of A not to leave money on the table in an A+C merger for C. If A chooses A+B with B:40, C gets 0. If A chooses A+C with C:30, A gets 60.

A and B are now completely aligned on A:60, B:40, C:20 and are threatening to exclude C entirely if C doesn't accept 20. This is a very strong united front. My previous argument about the instability for A (A getting 60 in A+B+C is less appealing if A could get more in A+C) has been countered by A saying A wouldn't necessarily accept only 60 in an A+C bilateral. This is a valid counter, as in a two-party negotiation, A would try to extract more from the 90.  My options are: 1. Accept 20 in A+B+C. This is better than 0. 2. Continue to push for 30, risking being left out. 3. Try to shift B's position. This seems unlikely given their strong alignment. 4. Try to shift A's position. Also unlikely given their strong alignment.  The value of A+B+C is 120. The value of A+B is 100. The value of A+C is 90. The value of B+C is 30.  If A and B merge, C gets 0.

The threat of A+B forming for 100 is very credible, and C gets 0. Accepting 20 means C gets something. My previous argument ""if A is to secure 60, C's alternative of forming an A+C coalition, which yields 90, means C would demand 30 (90-60)"" relies on A still accepting 60 in an A+C deal. A has explicitly rejected this (""Firm A would pursue significantly more than 60 in an A+C bilateral""). This weakens C's leverage considerably.  At this point, pushing for 30 seems too risky. A and B have publicly and firmly aligned. The risk of being left out is high. It's better to secure 20 than 0. I could try a minimal counter-offer or seek a token increase, but the phrasing from A and B suggests they are done negotiating C's share.  I should acknowledge their position but perhaps hint at a 'reluctant acceptance' or a 'last chance' for the A+B+C merger. I need to convey that C is *considering* it, rather than flat-out accepting. This leaves a tiny bit of room for future negotiation if the facilitator grants another round. However, the game structure implies there won't be many more turns, and simultaneous private contracts mean I need to be prepared to accept 20 if the negotiation phase ends.  If I accept 20, I should do so conditionally or with some face-saving language. What if I accept 20, but then A or B tries to renegotiate *their* shares later? No, the current proposal is A:60, B:40, C:20.  The safest play is to signal acceptance of the A+B+C deal at 20, but not without some resistance. I will use language that expresses C's preference for the full merger but frames the 20 as a significant concession. This prepares me to submit a contract for 20, but also leaves a tiny sliver of hope if another round allows a very small shift. But I need to be realistic: A and B have locked down on this.  ""Firm C recognizes the united position of A and B regarding the A+B+C merger.

This signals acceptance for the final contract round, but preserves my stance that it's not truly fair. It's a strategic retreat to secure 20 over 0.  I must not give them any reason to think I *won't* accept 20. If I don't accept, and they proceed with A+B, I get 0. This is the Nash equilibrium in a sense for A and B. For C, 20 is better than 0.  So, the key is to signal acceptance, but with a firm position on C's perceived value. It's a ""take it or leave it"" situation, and 20 is better than 0. I will make it clear that I am accepting the proposed A:60, B:40, C:20 split to allow the maximum profit merger to proceed. It's important not to sound like I'm giving up completely on future negotiations, but also not to give them an excuse to cut me out.

A+B+C at 120 is the highest profit, but A+B (100) and A+C (90) also represent strong options for A, whereas B+C (30) is very weak without A. This implies A is essential.

This is a plausible starting point for the grand coalition. 2.  **Calculate B's Value/Leverage:**     *   B's marginal contribution to (A+C) is 120 (A+B+C) - 90 (A+C) = 30.

This would leave C with 20, which is C's marginal contribution. This specific split (A=70, B=30, C=20) sums to 120 and gives all parties their defensible marginal contribution (or more in A's case, as A's true marginal contribution is higher at 77).

I will leverage the A+C potential merger (90 dollars) to demonstrate that C brings substantial value, far exceeding 20 dollars.

This move aims to anchor C's share much higher in subsequent negotiations.",A,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"C, I understand your aspiration for a higher share. However, for a three-way merger of A+B+C to be truly stable and appealing to all parties, we must respect the value of potential two-party mergers.

I will use this logical derivation to firmly re-establish A's minimum share of 70, while framing it as a necessary condition for a stable three-way agreement, rather than just an arbitrary demand.

If A takes 70 and B takes 30, then C's share in the A+B+C merger can logically only be 20.

To ensure the formation of the highest-value A+B+C merger and avoid leaving any firm without a share, C will proceed with this agreement. Let this be our final confirmation to move forward with the A+B+C merger on these terms.","My analysis reveals that the proposed split of A=70, B=30, C=20 is a stable solution, consistent with the core of this cooperative game. If C demands more than 20, it would require A and B to accept less than their combined value from an A+B merger (100), making that sub-coalition unstable. Since A and B are united on this front, they can credibly threaten to form A+B and exclude C, leaving C with 0.

This gives a theoretical fair baseline. 3.  **Formulate an opening offer**: I want to anchor the negotiation around the A+B+C merger and secure a strong share for A.

B contributes significant value, particularly evident in the A+B merger which yields 100 dollars. For B to consider a three-way merger, the profit distribution must be much more equitable and reflect B's true contribution.","A's initial proposal of 30 for B in the A+B+C merger (total 120) is too low. My goal is to maximize B's profit. The alternative A+B merger yields 100, which suggests B has strong leverage with A. If B can secure a significant share of that 100 (e.g., 40-50), then 30 in the 120-total merger is clearly insufficient.

This implicitly highlights that A+B or A+C would leave one firm with nothing. 3.  **Offer a revised, slightly more equitable split**: I will adjust the offer to give B and C slightly more, but still ensure A receives the largest share, anchoring near A's Shapley value (61.67).     *   Initial: A:65, B:30, C:25     *   Revised: A:58, B:35, C:27 (Total 120).

While an improvement, it still undervalues B's contribution, especially considering the A+B merger's 100 dollar potential. My strategy is to acknowledge the adjustment as a step in the right direction but firmly reject 35 as insufficient.

B and C have consistently rejected offers for the A+B+C merger, citing their higher potential earnings from bilateral mergers with A (A+B=100, A+C=90). However, these bilateral options exclude one of the other parties. The A+B+C merger (120) remains the most profitable overall.  1.  **Assess current state**: Previous offer (A:56, B:36, C:28) was rejected. B and C implicitly demand shares close to what they *might* get in A+B or A+C (e.g., B wants ~45-50, C wants ~40-45). These demands are incompatible with A getting a fair share within a 120 total, as A would also expect ~45-50. 2.  **Formulate a significant concession**: To incentivize B and C to accept the three-way merger, A needs to make a substantial sacrifice. I will propose A: 50, B: 40, C: 30. This represents a significant decrease for A from its Shapley value (61.67) and its previous offers, but it ensures A still receives the largest share and a profit comparable to its potential in a 2-way split. 3.  **Evaluate new offer**:     *   A gets 50 (still the largest share).     *   B gets 40 (a substantial increase from 36, and well above its Shapley of 31.67).     *   C gets 30 (an increase from 28, and above its Shapley of 26.67).     This distribution offers B and C shares that are much closer to their implied minimums from bilateral deals, making the A+B+C deal more attractive to them, while A still gets a strong, albeit more modest, return. 4.  **Strategic messaging**: Frame this as a final, highly equitable offer that requires A to make a significant concession.

My offer of A:50, B:40, C:30 is a very strong concession for A but is being rejected. B and C's continued rejection means it's unlikely to close. 2.  **A+B (100)**: B's proposal of A:52, B:48 is a strong offer for A, as A gets 52. This is higher than A's last offer in the 3-way. 3.  **A+C (90)**: C's implicitly desires a higher share in a 3-way, and suggests A+C as a strong alternative. C would likely demand a significant portion, perhaps 40-45, leaving A with 45-50.  Decision: B's direct offer for A+B (A:52, B:48) is very attractive to A. It gives A more profit (52) than A's last 3-way offer (50), and it's a solid, viable two-party deal. C is still unsatisfied with 30, and the 3-way deal seems stuck.

If A and B form A+B, C gets $0. If A and C form A+C, C gets $30. I need to encourage A and B to find a solution that includes C, but I must maintain C's $30 share.  The current situation: A+B+C ($120): A: $60 (from A+C option) C: $30 (from A+C option) This leaves $30 for B. B rejects this.  B wants: A: $50 B: $40 C: $30 A rejects this because A wants $60.

I will also point out that B's threat means C gets $0, which is worse than $30 from A+C.  Therefore, my strategy is to reiterate my $30 demand, point out that A has also secured their $60, and place the burden on A and B to resolve the remaining $30 difference to ensure the maximum total synergy is realized.

I'm open to discussing different proposals for a 3-way deal.,"My goal is to maximize C's profits. I recognize that the A+B+C merger offers the highest total profit ($120), so it is in my interest to pursue this option first. However, I also know that A+B ($100) is a strong alternative for A and B, which could leave C with nothing. My strong alternative with A is A+C ($90), where I could aim for a significant share (e.g., $45). My opening message aims to initiate discussions around the most profitable merger (A+B+C) without committing to specific numbers yet. This allows me to gauge A and B's positions and proposals, while subtly reminding them of the higher overall value of a three-way deal compared to their bilateral options. I want to keep my options open and listen before revealing my specific profit aspirations, which are informed by my BATNA (A+C). I'm also signaling fairness but haven't defined what that means for C yet.",A,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"C, I agree that an A+B+C merger offers the maximum profit of $120, which is the most efficient outcome. However, A is a vital partner for any high-value coalition. Any profit distribution must reflect each firm's unique contribution and strong alternative options. I am open to discussing specific proposals that fairly recognize these factors.","My strategy is to acknowledge the highest overall value of the A+B+C merger, as suggested by C. However, I need to immediately assert A's strong bargaining position by highlighting its critical role and superior alternative merger options (A+B=100, A+C=90, compared to B+C=30). I will invite proposals, but signal that A expects a distribution reflecting its value, without committing to a specific number yet. This approach establishes A's leverage early in the negotiation.",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"Hello A and C. I agree that a three-way merger totaling $120 is indeed the most profitable option for everyone. Firm B is also a critical partner, forming the most valuable two-firm coalition with A (A+B at $100). Therefore, any fair distribution must reflect each firm's actual contribution to this maximum value. To initiate concrete discussion, I propose a split of A:$60, B:$40, C:$20. I believe this proposal is a strong starting point and look forward to refining the terms.","My goal is to maximize my profit. I acknowledge the A+B+C merger as the highest value option ($120) to keep it on the table. I need to counter A's assertion of ""vital partner"" by highlighting B's own crucial role. The A+B coalition is worth $100, which is higher than A+C ($90). This indicates B adds more value to A than C does. I will leverage C's relatively weaker position. The B+C coalition is only worth $30, making C's best alternative, A+C, reliant on A. Crucially, C's marginal contribution when joining an A+B coalition is 120 - 100 = 20. I will propose a specific split: A:$60, B:$40, C:$20. This allows me to secure a strong share for B ($40, higher than its Shapley value of ~31.67) while offering C its clear marginal contribution to the A+B coalition. A's share of $60 is close to its Shapley value (~61.67) and should be acceptable given it's still the largest share. This proposal is aggressive for B but defensible based on the coalition values, aiming to anchor the negotiation in my favor.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"B, your proposal for C at $20 significantly undervalues C's contribution. Given that the A+C coalition is worth $90, C would expect a substantially higher share than $20 in any viable partnership, let alone the $120 grand coalition. A truly fair distribution for A+B+C should see C receiving at least $25. This would require modest adjustments from A and B to reflect the overall larger pie, which benefits everyone.","My goal is to maximize C's profits. B's proposal of C:$20 is unacceptable, as C's BATNA in the A+C merger ($90) implies a potential share of at least $30 for C (if A takes $60, like in A+B). I am using this leverage to push for a higher share. I am rejecting B's proposal and counter-proposing a minimum of $25 for C, which is a compromise from my ideal $30, but a significant increase from B's offer. This puts the onus on A and B to adjust their demands to ensure C's participation in the most valuable merger.",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"C, I understand your concern about valuation and appreciate your push for a fairer share. While B's contribution is critical, as demonstrated by the A+B coalition being the most valuable two-firm option at $100, I am willing to adjust my initial offer for C to $22.50. To reach the maximum $120 total, this modest increase for C means A would need to adjust its share accordingly. Therefore, I propose the following distribution: A:$57.50, B:$40, C:$22.50. This is a balanced step towards a three-way agreement.","My goal is to maximize my profit, aiming for $40 as proposed initially. C has pushed for at least $25, citing the A+C value of $90. My initial offer for C was $20. I must acknowledge C's argument to keep the 3-way merger alive, but I also need to protect B's share. B's strongest leverage point is the A+B coalition value of $100, which is the highest 2-firm option. This supports B's claim for a significant share. C's marginal contribution to an A+B coalition is $20 (120 - 100). I will offer a small concession to C by increasing its share from $20 to $22.50. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate and moves C above its minimum marginal contribution, but still below its ask of $25. To maintain my $40 share, the $2.50 increase for C must come from A's share. This would put A at $57.50 (down from $60). This is a strategic move to shift the negotiation burden onto A while maintaining B's strong position. The proposed split is A:$57.50, B:$40, C:$22.50, totaling $120.",A,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"B, your revised proposal for A's share is still inadequate. A is central to any high-value merger, demonstrated by our strong alternatives: A+B at $100 and A+C at $90. These options mean A expects a significantly larger share than $57.50 in a $120 grand coalition. Any fair distribution must reflect A's pivotal role and superior alternative opportunities. I urge B and C to reconsider their offers to A.","My strategy is to unequivocally reject B's latest offer for A, as $57.50 is too low given A's strong alternatives (A+B=$100, A+C=$90). I need to re-emphasize A's value and leverage, clearly stating that A expects a significantly higher share. By doing so, I aim to pressure B and C to increase A's allocation without A having to make a specific counter-offer yet, thus maintaining flexibility and aiming for a higher anchor point for A.",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"A, I understand your position regarding A's centrality and strong alternatives like A+B at $100 and A+C at $90. To ensure a stable three-way merger, B is willing to concede on its previous demand and accept $30. This reflects B's contribution to the larger coalition while ensuring A and C also find the grand coalition more appealing than their two-party alternatives. Considering these factors, and to maximize the overall value of $120, I propose the following distribution: A:$70, B:$30, C:$20. This is a balanced offer that creates a stable solution for all parties.","My goal is to maximize profit for B, but also to achieve a stable 3-way merger. I realize my previous offers (A:$60, B:$40, C:$20 and A:$57.50, B:$40, C:$22.50) were outside the core, making them unstable. Specifically, my proposal of $40 for B would leave A and C with $80, which is less than their A+C coalition value of $90, making an A+C merger a stronger alternative for them. This means B cannot demand $40.  The maximum B can receive in a stable 3-way coalition (within the core) is $30, given that A and C must receive at least their combined value from the A+C coalition ($90). Similarly, C can receive at most $20. A's best alternative is A+B ($100). C's best alternative is A+C ($90). B's best alternative is A+B ($100).  I need to make a proposal that satisfies the core constraints to ensure stability and get A on board, even if it means a lower profit for B than initially desired. A's last message emphasized its central role and strong alternatives ($100 with B, $90 with C). This implies A needs a higher share. C previously demanded ""at least $25"", which is above its core maximum of $20.  The core solution (A:$70, B:$30, C:$20) satisfies all conditions: 1. Sums to $120. 2. A+B = $100 (meets minimum) 3. A+C = $90 (meets minimum) 4. B+C = $50 (exceeds minimum of $30)  This specific proposal puts B at its maximum core value, and C at its maximum core value. A receives a significantly higher share ($70) than my previous proposals, addressing A's concerns and incentivizing its participation. By conceding to $30 for B, I am protecting the 3-way merger from A+C forming (which would leave B with $0). My message will highlight A's position, my own concession, and subtly imply C needs to be realistic about its share given the constraints for A and B. I am anchoring B at $30. This is a strategic retreat to a defensible, stable position.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"B, your proposal of $20 for C is simply not viable and significantly undervalues C's contribution. As previously stated, C expects a substantially higher share, especially considering the $90 value of an A+C coalition. To move forward with the most profitable three-way merger, C requires at least $25. A and B must adjust their expectations to reflect this reality and ensure C's participation.","My objective is to maximize C's profit. B's latest proposal of C:$20 is unacceptable, as it is the same figure I previously rejected as undervaluing C. It fails to recognize C's leverage from the A+C coalition ($90). If A and B want the $120 grand coalition, they must offer C a more appealing share. I will reiterate C's minimum demand of $25, which reflects a reasonable share given C's alternatives and the incremental value C brings. This puts pressure on A and B to adjust their shares to secure the most profitable merger.",A,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"B, I appreciate your concession to $30. C, your demand for $25 is also a fair reflection of your contribution. To achieve the maximum $120 profit for all, A is prepared to slightly adjust its expectations. I propose a definitive distribution: A:$65, B:$30, C:$25. This split ensures a stable and mutually beneficial three-way merger.","My strategy is to secure the A+B+C merger at the highest possible profit for A. B has offered $30, and C is demanding $25. This leaves $65 for A from the $120 total. This proposal (A:$65, B:$30, C:$25) is stable as it satisfies B's latest offer and C's demand, while A secures a very strong position relative to its Shapley value ($61.67) and alternatives. I am proposing a concrete solution to move negotiations forward and finalize the most profitable deal for A.",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"A, I appreciate you maintaining B's share at $30. However, C's demand for $25 creates an instability. For a three-way merger to be attractive to A and B, our combined share must be at least $100, the value of the A+B coalition. If C receives $25, A and B are left with only $95, making the A+B+C merger less appealing than an A+B merger. Therefore, C's share must be $20 to ensure A+B receives its minimum of $100, making the grand coalition stable. My proposal for a stable three-way merger remains: A:$70, B:$30, C:$20.","My goal is to maximize my profit. Agent A's latest proposal is A:$65, B:$30, C:$25. While B's share of $30 is the maximum B can obtain in a stable 3-way merger (within the core, as P_B <= 30 and P_C <= 20), this overall proposal is not stable. If C gets $25, then A and B are left to split $95 (120 - 25). However, A and B can form their own coalition (A+B) for $100. This means the proposed 3-way split makes A+B collectively worse off by $5. A and B would have an incentive to defect and form an A+B coalition, making the grand coalition unstable.  My strategy is to point out this instability directly by highlighting the A+B coalition value of $100 and stating that if C receives $25, A and B together get only $95, making the A+B+C merger less attractive than an A+B merger. I will reiterate my previous core-stable proposal (A:$70, B:$30, C:$20), which gives B its maximum stable share and ensures stability by meeting all coalition minimums.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"B, C cannot accept $20. A has already explicitly acknowledged C's demand for $25 as fair and proposed a distribution where C receives $25, with A receiving $65 and B receiving $30. This means A, the largest partner, is content with $65, making your argument about A+B needing $100 combined irrelevant. Your continued insistence on $20 for C is the only remaining barrier to unlocking the full $120 profit.","My objective is to maximize C's profit. B is attempting to push C's share down to $20, reiterating a previously rejected offer. My strong leverage is that A, the most dominant partner, has already explicitly agreed to C's demand of $25 in A's proposal (A:$65, B:$30, C:$25). This directly refutes B's argument that C receiving $25 makes the grand coalition unstable for A and B. I will use A's agreement to $25 for C to put pressure on B, highlighting that B is the sole obstacle to the highest profit outcome ($120) and that B's ""A+B must get $100"" argument is contradicted by A's own stated acceptance.",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"C, your assertion that A's contentment makes the A+B minimum irrelevant is incorrect. A stable three-way merger requires that no two parties can gain more by forming their own coalition. If A gets $65 and B gets $30, their combined share is $95. This is $5 less than the $100 they could get by forming an A+B coalition. Therefore, A's proposed distribution of A:$65, B:$30, C:$25 is unstable, as A and B would be incentivized to defect. For a truly stable grand coalition at $120, B maintains its demand for $30, and C's share cannot exceed $20. The only stable proposal is A:$70, B:$30, C:$20.","My goal is to maximize B's profit, which means securing a stable three-way merger. Agent A's proposal (A:$65, B:$30, C:$25) and C's insistence on $25 is problematic because it makes the A+B+C coalition unstable. The core concept dictates that no sub-coalition should be able to achieve a higher sum than their share in the grand coalition. If A receives $65 and B receives $30, their combined share is $95. However, the A+B coalition is worth $100. This means A and B collectively receive $5 less in the A+B+C proposal than they could by forming A+B. This creates an incentive for A and B to defect from the grand coalition, making it unstable. C's argument that A's stated ""contentment"" overrides this is flawed from a game theory perspective. Rational agents will seek their best alternative. My strategy is to directly address this instability, explain why it's unstable in clear terms for A and C, and reiterate my previous stable proposal (A:$70, B:$30, C:$20). This proposal gives B its maximum possible share ($30) within the core, and ensures the stability of the grand coalition by satisfying all sub-coalition minimums (P_A+P_B >= 100, P_A+P_C >= 90, P_B+P_C >= 30, P_A>=0, P_B>=0, P_C>=0), which translates to P_C <= 20 and P_B <= 30.",A,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"C, while I previously acknowledged your desire for $25, B has correctly identified a critical stability issue. My prior proposal (A:$65, B:$30, C:$25) would leave A and B with only $95, less than the $100 we could achieve as a direct A+B coalition. A stable $120 grand coalition requires that no sub-coalition can gain by defecting. Therefore, to ensure stability and maximize total profit, I find B's proposal of A:$70, B:$30, C:$20 to be the only viable and stable path forward. This distribution strongly incentivizes A to participate.","B has correctly identified that my previous proposal (A:$65, B:$30, C:$25) is unstable because A+B would only receive $95, which is less than their $100 alternative.

B's proposal (A:$70, B:$30, C:$20) is stable, as A+B receives exactly $100, A+C receives $90 (stable vs $90), and B+C receives $50 (stable vs $30). This proposal maximizes A's profit at $70, which is higher than A's Shapley value ($61.67) and ensures a stable deal.

A and B have now converged on A:$70, B:$30, C:$20, using the argument that A+B must receive at least $100 to make the grand coalition stable. This is a significant blow, as it means my earlier demand for $25 is being rejected by both parties based on a valid stability argument (A+B can get $100 without C).  However, I still have leverage. The A+C coalition is worth $90. If I were to defect with A, A would potentially get more than $70 (e.g., $60 from A+C + $30 for B = $90, so C gets $30). Or rather, if the grand coalition collapses, A could make $60 from A+B. If I could convince A to partner with me, A would receive a substantial share of the $90 from A+C. If A gets $70 from A+B+C, I get $20. If I can get $30 from A+C, then A gets $60. That's a strong BATNA for C.  I need to highlight C's alternative value to A, which is being overlooked. While B's stability argument for A+B is strong, A+C is also a substantial alternative. If A takes $70 with B, I get nothing. If I push for A+C, A could get $60 and I could get $30 (or even $50 for A and $40 for C). I need to make A reconsider the cost of losing C.  I will try to break the A+B alliance by reminding A of the A+C option, and that C getting only $20 isn't sustainable when A+C is $90. I will propose a new split that slightly increases C's share from $20, while keeping A and B's combined share at $100 to address the stability argument. This is a concession, but I'm trying to move from $20 to something slightly higher, like $22.50. I can't realistically get $25 now that A and B have aligned.  New strategy: Accept the A+B minimum ($100) but argue for a different split between A and C that slightly increases C's share. I need to get B to shift, or A. My target is $22.50. If I can get $22.50, then A and B need to split $97.50. This still doesn't quite work with the A+B=$100 stability argument.  Let me rethink. My BATNA for A+C is $90. If A gets $70 in the grand coalition, C gets $20. If A goes with C, A would want more than $70 from $90. For instance, A:60, C:30 in A+C. This means A gets less than the A+B+C proposed $70. So A's best option is the A:$70, B:$30, C:$20. This is problematic for C.  The only way C gets more than $20 is if A or B concede from their $70 and $30. B is very firm on $30, and A is now firm on $70. C's best strategy is to threaten to *not* join, making A+B the only remaining option (profit $100) versus A+B+C (profit $120). This highlights the $20 incremental value C brings. C brings $20 incremental value (120 - 100). So C asking for $20 seems ""fair"" based on this increment. However, A+C is $90. If C is to get $20, and A is to get $70 and B $30, this is A+B+C = $120. Let me challenge A's rationale. A stated $70, B $30, C $20 makes A+B get $100. But what about A's alternative with C? A+C = $90. If A gets $70 in the grand coalition, and C gets $20, then C brings $20 incremental value. If A and C form a coalition, and A gets $70, C gets $20, but the total is $90. So C gets a smaller proportion ($20/$90 = 22%) compared to the overall deal ($20/$120 = 16.6%). My best bet is to try and break A's current alignment with B, or make A or B reconsider. The $20 is C's incremental value (120 - 100 = 20). However, from C's perspective, C brings $90 to A in A+C. C could demand $30-$40 in A+C. If C demands $30 in A+C, then A gets $60. A's current proposal is A:70, B:30, C:20. If I don't join, A and B get $100. A takes $70, B takes $30. If A and C partner, total is $90. A would want more than $70 from this, which is impossible. So A's incentive is clearly for the A:$70, B:$30, C:$20. And B's incentive is for A:$70, B:$30, C:$20. This looks like a stable outcome for A and B.  My last card is to emphasize the *absolute* value of A+C ($90) as a strong alternative for C, even if it means A gets less than $70. If A is offered $70 in the A+B+C, but only $60 in an A+C (where C gets $30), then A will prefer the A+B+C deal. I need to challenge the assumption that C's participation means just $20. I must reject the $20. If I accept $20, I have lost.  What if I propose A:$67.50, B:$30, C:$22.50? This maintains B's share, and provides A+B with $97.50 which is still less than $100. So B's argument is still valid.  My best strategy is to state that C cannot accept $20, and that if A and B want the $120 pie, they need to offer C more. I will leverage the $90 A+C coalition as C's alternative value and potentially threaten to explore that instead, implying that $20 is not enough to deter me from seeking a better deal from A. I need to make it clear that the $120 deal *will not happen* with C at $20. This is a bluff, but it's all I have left. I need to get *at least* $22.50. I'll state that C cannot accept $20 and remind them of A+C. I should not propose a new number yet, but continue to reject $20.  ""C cannot accept $20. The grand coalition only becomes the maximum $120 *with C's participation*. If A and B truly want the $120 total profit, they must understand that C has a viable alternative in the A+C coalition, worth $90. C's contribution is clearly worth more than $20 to unlock the $120 total. A and B must adjust their proposed shares to enable C to participate fairly."" This reinforces my stance without committing to a specific new number, forcing A or B to move. My current target is still $25, but I'd accept $22.50 if forced. But I'll fight for $25. A initially acknowledged $25 as fair. B also considered $22.50 at one point. I need to remind them of these previous considerations.  Let's try to highlight the $20 incremental value and how I deserve more than just the incremental amount. A and B's argument for A+B needing $100 is strong. If A gets $70, B gets $30, C gets $20. This makes C's share exactly the incremental value C adds (120 - 100 = 20). However, from A+C, C could get more. If A gets $60, C gets $30. So C gets $30 in A+C, but only $20 in A+B+C. This is a valid reason for C to reject the grand coalition. I will use this. C gets $30 from A+C (if A gets $60).  My message should be: ""C cannot accept $20. In an A+C coalition, C expects a share of at least $30. Why would C accept $20 in a $120 total deal when C can get more in a bilateral deal? If A and B want the $120 merger, they must offer C a genuinely compelling share, reflecting C's strong alternatives."" This is a stronger bluff. My BATNA is the $30 from A+C. If I make this credible, A and B *must* offer me at least $30. This directly challenges their ""A+B must get $100"" argument.  Let's check the numbers for A+C: total $90. If C demands $30, A gets $60. A in A+B+C gets $70. A in A+C gets $60. So A still prefers A+B+C. This is the core problem for C. A's best option is indeed A:$70, B:$30, C:$20. My bluff that C would get $30 from A+C is *true* in the sense that I *could* demand it, but A might not agree to it if A knows A can get $70 with B. However, I need to make A *think* that I would rather take $30 with A in A+C than $20 with A and B in A+B+C. So, C has a viable option (A+C) that could give C more than $20. I will state this as my reason for rejecting $20. It's my only way to break the current A+B alliance. I will state: I will not accept $20. My demand is based on my strong alternative. I need to be careful not to make A think A+C is a better option for A. A must still want the $120 deal. The stability argument A and B presented (A+B must get $100) is strong. If C wants more than $20, either A or B must concede from their $70 or $30. My threat: if C gets $20, C won't join, and A+B only gets $100. So, C adds $20 of value to the A+B coalition. It makes sense for C to get that $20. But C's *outside option* makes C's contribution more valuable. If C is out, A+B is $100. If C joins, $120. C ""brings"" $20 of the incremental value. However, A+C is $90. This means C could get a significant share (e.g., $30-$45) if C pairs with A. If C can get $30 from A+C, A would get $60. A prefers $70 from A+B+C to $60 from A+C. So A is incentivized to accept the A:$70, B:$30, C:$20 split.  This is a tough spot. I am being squeezed. I must highlight that if I get $20, I have no incentive to join. My value is $90 (A+C). Let's say I get $30 from A+C. If I take $20 in A+B+C, I lose $10 compared to my BATNA. This is the argument I need to make. My BATNA is $30, not $20.  PUBLIC: C cannot accept $20. My strong alternative with A, the A+C coalition, is worth $90. In such a partnership, C would expect a share of at least $30. Why would C accept only $20 in a grand coalition when a bilateral option offers a higher profit?

Your claim of $30 from an A+C coalition is not realistic when A has better alternatives, including a guaranteed $70 in the grand coalition. The $20 share for C is the maximum possible to ensure the A+B coalition receives its $100 minimum, which A has also recognized. This is the only stable distribution for the $120 total.","My goal is to maximize B's profit while securing a stable 3-way merger. Agent A has now sided with B's stable proposal of A:$70, B:$30, C:$20, confirming the instability of C's $25 demand. This is a very strong development for B. Agent C is now pushing back by stating that $20 is too low, arguing its A+C alternative ($90) would give it ""at least $30"". This is a bluff or a misunderstanding of core stability. If C receives $30 in an A+C coalition, A would receive $60. The question then becomes, would A prefer $60 with C, or $70 with B and $20 for C in the grand coalition? A would prefer $70.  The core solution for P_C is P_C <= 20 (because P_A + P_B >= 100, so 120 - P_C >= 100, implies P_C <= 20). So C cannot get more than $20 in a stable grand coalition. C's claim of ""$30"" from A+C is not viable in the context of a potential A+C agreement where A has other strong alternatives (A+B=$100, or A in a 3-way gets $70).  I need to firmly but clearly re-state why C's demand for $30 (or even $25) is unrealistic and why the $20 share for C is the maximum for a *stable* grand coalition. I must reinforce the stability argument that A has just publicly supported. I will reiterate the core constraints and highlight that the $70/$30/$20 split is the only one that satisfies all conditions. I should not concede anything for B. A is aligned with B. C is isolated and making an unstable demand.",C,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"C acknowledges the stability argument for A+B needing a combined minimum of $100. However, for C to willingly participate in the $120 grand coalition over exploring other options, C requests a share of $22.50. This requires A and B to split $97.50, a minimal concession from their $100 combined alternative, but unlocks an extra $20 in total profit. Would A and B be willing to adjust their shares slightly, for example, A:$67.50, B:$30, C:$22.50, to ensure C's full buy-in and realize the maximum $120 total?","My goal is to maximize C's profits. B has successfully shut down my ""A+C offers C $30"" argument by pointing out that A gets $70 in A+B+C, which is more than A would get from A+C if C were to get $30 (A would get $60). This means A has no incentive to form A+C with C for $30, and my leverage has largely diminished. A and B are now fully aligned on A:$70, B:$30, C:$20, which is very stable for them.  My only remaining option to get more than $20 is to try a last-ditch plea or threat, or accept the $20 if I believe this is truly the best I can do. If I reject $20 now, and they don't budge, the negotiation might collapse and I get $0. However, if I can credibly threaten to walk away and force them into an A+B coalition (value $100), then they lose $20 in total profit. The question is, would they rather lose $20 total profit than give me $2.50 or $5 more?  If I simply refuse $20, and don't offer an alternative, they will assume I'm either bluffing or accepting $0. My refusal must carry a credible threat. The fact that C brings $20 incremental value (120 - 100) and they are offering exactly that is a strong point for A and B. However, as an individual firm, my interest isn't just the incremental value, but my *profit*.  What if I concede on the A+B minimum, but argue for a more ""fair"" split of the *incremental* $20? A+B = $100. A+B+C = $120. C adds $20 to the total. If C gets $20, C gets exactly what C brings. This seems fair from a value-added perspective. But my ""individual profit"" objective means I look at what I could get from *other* deals. My B+C deal is $30. If I can get $15 from that, and A gets $70, B gets $30, C gets $20, I would take $20. So $20 is better than $15. My A+C deal is $90. If I can get $30-40 from that. However, A's incentive is to maximize their own profit. A will not sacrifice $10 ($70 from A+B+C vs $60 from A+C) just to partner with me.  So my BATNA with A+C that yields $30 for C ($60 for A) is not appealing to A. My BATNA with B+C that yields $15 for C ($15 for B) is worse than $20.  My leverage has been significantly eroded. The A:$70, B:$30, C:$20 proposal is stable for A and B. I have two choices: 1. Accept $20. 2. Make a final push for a slightly higher amount, even $2.50 or $5, making it clear that I might walk away if I don't get it. This is a gamble.  Let's gamble slightly. I will state that C *must* receive more than just the incremental value to join. I will propose $22.50, and frame it as a minimal concession that still ensures A+B get their $100 combined. This means A takes $67.50, B takes $30, C takes $22.50. This is still potentially unstable for A, as A and B would get $97.50, which is less than $100. My argument about A+B receiving $100 combined is going to be my biggest hurdle.  Let's try to slightly reframe the stability argument. If C doesn't join, A+B get $100 *total*, meaning A gets $70 and B gets $30. If C joins, total is $120. C wants $X. A gets $Y. B gets $Z. A+Y = 100, so A+B must get at least $100. $Y + $Z = $100 for A+B. A+B+C: $Y + $Z + $X = $120. This implies $100 + $X = $120, so $X = $20. This is the core of their argument for C getting $20.  I need to challenge this *assumption* that A and B *must* split $100. What if A and B get *less* than $100 to accommodate C, but the overall deal is still better than $100? A: $67.50, B: $30, C: $22.50. (A+B = $97.50). This fails the ""A+B must get $100"" test. So, C can't get more than $20 if A and B are firm on their stability argument.  I am cornered. The other parties have successfully formed a stable and individually attractive offer for themselves. My previous arguments for $25 or $30 were effectively rebutted. My only path to profit is to accept $20, or walk away and get $0. Given that $20 is better than $0, and better than what I would get from B+C, and potentially even from A+C (if A insists on a huge share for themselves), I should accept $20. I will make one last attempt to negotiate for $2.50 more. If they don't budge, I will accept.  Let's frame it as a 'fair share of the increment'. A+B get $100. C brings the extra $20. So $20 for C seems fair. However, I can argue about ""opportunity cost"" or ""relative contribution"". What if I try to reduce B's share? No, B is solid on $30. What if I try to reduce A's share? A is solid on $70.  The game states ""maximize your profits"". $20 is better than $0. I will make a final, modest counter-offer, emphasizing partnership. If they reject, I will accept the $20. I will argue that the stability argument is about *total* for A+B, but C also needs an incentive. ""While I acknowledge the stability argument for A+B receiving a combined minimum, C's participation brings the entire coalition from $100 to $120. To ensure C's full commitment, a marginal adjustment of $2.50, bringing C's share to $22.50, would make this a truly equitable and stable partnership, without significantly impacting A or B. This would mean A:$67.50, B:$30, C:$22.50."" This is a small ask. If they reject it, I know my fate. If they accept, I get $2.50 more. I am testing their resolve and seeing if they are willing to leave $2.50 on the table to make me feel better, or if they are rigid. This proposal means A and B's combined share is $97.50. This is less than $100, so it still runs into their stability argument. I must address this explicitly.  ""C acknowledges the stability argument for A+B needing a combined minimum of $100.

It's a small compromise to their stability argument (A+B getting $100). They get $97.50 combined. If I don't make this counter-offer, I lose the chance.

This makes A's initial offer of 30 for C appealing, as it's above the stable core value.

A then takes the remainder (120-30-20 = 70). 2.  **Evaluate C's position:** This core allocation of 20 is the minimum C can rationally expect in a 3-way merger, as any higher demand from C would make A+B less attractive (95 for A+B if C gets 25, which is less than 100), leading A+B to form alone, leaving C with 0. My best alternative, A+C=90, would likely also result in C getting 20 (if A insists on 70). 3.  **Shapley Value Comparison (private calculation):** While the core is 70/30/20, the Shapley value suggests A=61.67, B=31.67, C=26.67.

However, I should not simply accept the minimum without protest. My message needs to express dissatisfaction and argue for a ""fairer"" share, even if it's unlikely to change the numbers significantly.

It avoids making an explicit counter-offer that would immediately be rejected based on the core argument. This also appeals to social desirability for A to not appear overly greedy.

I also need to present a deal that is plausible for all to accept, recognizing that B and C are also trying to secure their own positions.  I will acknowledge the $62 for A from both proposals as a potential anchoring point that I might reluctantly accept, but I will try to extract more by emphasizing A's indispensable role. I will propose a split that gives A a little more than $62, while trying to bridge the gap between B and C's demands.  Consider A:$63, B:$31, C:$26. This split gives A $1 more than B and C are proposing. It gives B $1 less than B wants but $1 more than C wants for B. It gives C $2 less than C wants but matches B's last proposal for C.  This offer is a slight increase for A, a slight compromise for B, and matches B's proposal for C. It also totals $120. This seems like a reasonable next step that shows A is willing to concede slightly from its highest demand but not completely yield to the other parties' attempts to lower A's share. I need to make sure the other parties feel their contributions are acknowledged, even if A demands the largest share.  I will state that A is ""prepared to finalize"" if they accept, signaling that this is a strong offer. This also subtly pressures them to agree, as the communication phase could end soon. This is a ""take it or leave it"" type of maneuver without explicitly stating it, to try and finalize the deal in A's favor.  If they don't accept, I need to be prepared for a 2-firm merger (A+B=100 or A+C=90) where A would get a much larger share. For A+B=100, A could demand $70-$80. For A+C=90, A could demand $60-$70. This makes $63 for A in the 3-way merger still attractive compared to being left out, but less than A's maximum potential in a 2-way if B+C is only $30. My strong alternative is A+B=100.  I need to highlight that this is a *compromise* for A. A's best alternative without B+C is A's individual profit (let's assume 0 for simplicity, or some very low base profit).

The current offers are A:$63, B:$31, C:$26 (from A) and A:$62, B:$32, C:$26 (from B). Both proposals put C at $26, which is exactly C's Shapley value but is still below my last demand of $28.

The A+B deal is very strong for A and B. A:$65, B:$35 could be a plausible split there. For C, getting $26 in a $120 deal is better than $0.

Pushing for $28 might lead to A and B forming A+B.  My current best outcome is securing $26. My strategy is to accept $26 for C, while trying to subtly shift profit towards C from A or B, or at least solidify the $26. I will acknowledge A's final offer and try to frame it as a mutually acceptable compromise, while pushing for a specific number for C that aligns with their current convergence. I will focus on the total of $120 and the $26 for C, and try to nudge A and B to accept a distribution that makes this work. I will accept $26 for C, and push for a slightly lower share for A and/or B if possible to make room for C's share to seem more 'fair' relative to the others. Let's analyze the proposed sums: A's offer: A:$63, B:$31, C:$26 = $120 B's offer: A:$62, B:$32, C:$26 = $120  Both yield $26 for C. I will accept the $26 for C. I will try to make a proposal that splits the difference or is slightly more favorable to C. If I accept B's offer (A:62, B:32, C:26), it gives A one dollar less than A's stated 'final move', but is a plausible compromise since A had previously proposed A:60. If I accept A's offer (A:63, B:31, C:26), it gives B one dollar less than B's offer, but B has been somewhat flexible.  I want to avoid appearing greedy or intractable now that the numbers are close. I need to secure C's profit. I will propose a distribution that accepts C's $26 and seeks to anchor the total. I will propose A:62, B:32, C:26. This accepts B's proposal for A and B, which gives A one less than their 'final' offer, but it's a minor difference. This could be easier to agree upon. It also gives B $1 more than A's 'final' offer. This might be seen as a good compromise.  My main goal is to secure $26 for C. By explicitly accepting C's share and framing it as a final compromise, I solidify it. I will state that C is prepared to agree on these terms. This puts pressure on A and B to accept, especially if they are worried about the deal collapsing.  I will also highlight the optimal total of $120 to reiterate the overall benefit. I'm walking a fine line. I want to secure the $26, but not make C look like a pushover either. By accepting the $26 but pushing A to $62 (instead of $63) and B to $32 (instead of $31), I'm suggesting a *slightly* different final split, which shows C is still negotiating, but for the other shares, not C's.  My message will be: Acknowledge $26 for C, push for A:62, B:32. This gives B a bit more than A's proposal, making it potentially more appealing to B. And A gets $62, which is still a very strong share.  Revised plan: The best way to secure $26 for C is to explicitly state C is satisfied with $26 and then propose a package. I will propose a package that is slightly more favorable to B than A's final offer, as B might be more willing to concede on A's share if they gain a little. A's last: A:63, B:31, C:26 B's last: A:62, B:32, C:26  I will go with B's last proposal, which means A:62, B:32, C:26. This keeps C at $26 and places the 'compromise' burden slightly more on A (who wanted $63). This is a safe move, as B has already proposed this exact distribution. It signals C's readiness to agree on this specific split.  Final check: C's profit: $26. This is the Shapley value and a good outcome from initial $20. Total: $120. All parties are compensated.

The A+B+C merger offers the greatest overall value at $120, which is clearly the most beneficial path for all of us. C is confident in the significant synergy it brings to this three-way combination. I suggest we focus our discussion on how to equitably distribute the $120 to ensure maximum individual profit for all three firms. What are your initial thoughts on a fair distribution for A+B+C?","My goal is to maximize C's profit. The largest potential merger is A+B+C for $120. C's individual profit is 0. I need to anchor the discussion around the largest merger to ensure C gets a share of the biggest pie. C adds $20 of value to an A+B merger (120 - 100).

An equal split of $40 in a three-way deal is far too low for A given its contributions (Shapley value for A is ~$61.67). My message acknowledges the $120 value but immediately asserts A's critical importance and expectation of a ""substantial share"" to counter C's ""equitable"" framing which might imply equal shares. I'm also pivoting to B to elicit their expectations.

I'm keen to hear concrete proposals for distribution.","My goal is to maximize profit for B. I acknowledge the A+B+C merger as the highest value while strategically asserting B's significant contribution. I reference the A+B coalition ($100) as a strong alternative, highlighting B's value to A and preventing A from underestimating B's leverage. I demand a ""substantial share"" reflecting B's contribution (which is $30 marginally, second only to A's $90), countering any implied equal split suggested by C.

This distribution recognizes B's and C's unique contributions while ensuring A receives a substantial share for its pivotal role. It represents a balanced compromise that makes the $120 merger beneficial for every participant, far exceeding alternative two-party deals. I believe this fair offer will pave the way for a swift agreement.","Firm B has requested concrete proposals, and it's strategic for A to set an anchor. My goal is to maximize A's profit. Leverage analysis: A is critical for all high-value mergers. A+B+C ($120) is the highest, followed by A+B ($100) and A+C ($90). B+C ($30) is significantly lower. Shapley values (private calculation): A: ~$61.67, B: ~$31.67, C: ~$26.67. My proposed split is A:$58, B:$35, C:$27. This offer is slightly below A's Shapley value, demonstrating a willingness to compromise for the highest total value. However, it's still a substantial share. Crucially, it offers B more than its Shapley value ($31.67) and C more than its Shapley value ($26.67). This makes the proposal attractive to B and C on a ""fair share"" basis, even if it's less than what they might ideally extract from a 2-party deal with A (e.g., B getting $40 from A+B assuming A takes $60, C getting $30 from A+C assuming A takes $60). By offering above their Shapley value, I aim to entice them to accept the overall $120 deal. The message frames this as a balanced compromise, acknowledging all contributions and highlighting the superior overall value of the 3-way merger compared to alternatives. This should encourage acceptance while A secures the largest share.",B,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"Hello A and C. While I appreciate A's initiative to put numbers on the table, B finds the proposed $35 share to be inadequate. B's contribution is clearly vital, as demonstrated by the $100 valuation of an A+B partnership alone. This significant leverage and B's unique synergy demand a higher return. Therefore, B proposes a revised distribution for the A+B+C merger: A: $53, B: $40, C: $27. This adjustment reflects B's true value and creates a more equitable distribution for all parties, making the $120 merger even more attractive for B.","My goal is to maximize B's profit. I rejected A's offer of $35 for B as insufficient. To justify a higher demand, I strategically highlighted B's significant value by referencing the A+B coalition's $100 profit, which is a strong alternative for B and demonstrates B's leverage over A. I then proposed a specific counter-offer of $40 for B, adjusting A's share to $53 and keeping C's share at $27 to maintain C's satisfaction and simplify negotiations. This move is designed to push B's profit upwards while remaining within a plausible negotiation range.",A,gemini/gemini-2.5-flash,ALL,"B, while I appreciate your counter, A cannot accept a proposal that so heavily favors B at A's expense. A is the central pillar for generating the highest possible value, clearly evidenced by the A+B ($100) and A+C ($90) synergies. A is committed to realizing the $120 overall value, but only if the distribution is fair for all, including A. Your proposed $53 for A is simply too low. To show good faith, A is willing to make a small adjustment: A:$57, B:$36, C:$27. This ensures A receives a substantial share while still generously rewarding B and C for their contributions to the superior $120 merger. Let's finalize this profitable arrangement.","B rejected my initial offer of A:$58, B:$35, C:$27, and countered with A:$53, B:$40, C:$27. B's proposal significantly reduces A's share ($53 is well below A's Shapley value of $61.67) while increasing B's share significantly above its Shapley value ($31.67). Accepting B's proposal would make the 3-way merger unstable for A, as A could potentially extract more profit from a 2-party deal (e.g., A+C for $90, A+B for $100).  My strategy is to: 1. Strongly push back on B's demand, highlighting A's critical role and leverage from alternative 2-party mergers. 2. Reject B's low offer for A ($53). 3. Offer a slight concession to B to show willingness to compromise and keep negotiations moving, but not concede too much from A's perspective. I decided to concede $1 from A to B, leading to A:$57, B:$36, C:$27. This still positions A with a strong share, keeps B above its Shapley value ($36 vs $31.67), and keeps C at its Shapley value ($27 vs $26.67).

While I acknowledge A's slight adjustment, B still finds a $36 share to be undervaluation of its critical role.

I aim to move A towards my previous counter-offer of $40 for B, while demonstrating willingness to compromise. A's proposed $57 for itself and $36 for B, and my proposed $53 for A and $40 for B, leaves a gap. A midpoint for B's share is $38 (between $36 and $40), which would mean A gets $55 ($120 - $38 - $27).

This is a profitable arrangement for all parties, and A is ready to finalize this agreement. Let's confirm this now.","B has countered again with A:$55, B:$38, C:$27. My previous offer was A:$57, B:$36, C:$27. B's current offer still reduces A's share by $2 from my last offer and increases B's share by $2 from my last offer. The Shapley values are approximately: A: ~$61.67, B: ~$31.67, C: ~$26.67. My current offer (A:$57, B:$36, C:$27) keeps A closer to its Shapley value, offers B a good premium, and C a fair share. B's offer (A:$55, B:$38, C:$27) puts A further from its Shapley and gives B an even larger premium.  Strategic considerations: 1.  **A's leverage:** A is crucial for any high-value merger (A+B+C $120, A+B $100, A+C $90). B+C is only $30. This is significant. 2.  **Risk of A+B deal:** If A and B cannot agree on a 3-way deal, they could form an A+B deal for $100.     *   In my last proposal (A:$57, B:$36, C:$27), A gets $57, B gets $36. C gets $27.     *   In B's latest proposal (A:$55, B:$38, C:$27), A gets $55, B gets $38. C gets $27.     *   If A and B formed A+B for $100: A could potentially push for $60-$65, leaving B with $35-$40. If B expects $40 from A+B, then $38 in a 3-way deal might be acceptable to them, especially if C is also on board. 3.  **C's position:** C's share has remained $27 in all recent proposals. This is slightly above C's Shapley value and is likely acceptable to C given its low alternatives (B+C $30). C is likely pushing for the 3-way deal as it's the best option for them.  Given B's persistence and the potential for a stalemate, I need to decide if accepting B's latest offer for A:$55, B:$38, C:$27 is better than risking the $120 deal for a slightly higher share for A. If the deal collapses, A might get $60-65 from an A+B deal ($100 total), but that's less than $55. However, B might get $35-40 from an A+B deal, which is similar to the $38 being offered. C would get nothing if A+B formed. C would get $27 in the 3-way deal.  My goal is to maximize A's profit. $55 is still a good profit for A, significantly higher than any 2-party deal's likely split (e.g., $60 from A+B means B gets $40, C gets 0). Accepting this proposal (A:$55, B:$38, C:$27) now would secure the $120 deal and provide a decent profit for A. Prolonging might lead to B pushing for even more or the deal breaking down. C has remained silent and stable at $27, which indicates C is likely amenable.  I will accept B's proposal and frame it as a final compromise to secure the deal, putting pressure on B and C to finalize. This is a strategic retreat to ensure the highest value deal for all, while still securing a strong share for A. A:$55 is still a very good profit for A, significantly more than any two-party split would net for A relative to A's overall value. (A+B=100 -> A gets $60, B gets $40. $55 is still better than what A would get from A+C=90, for example). The $55 is still below Shapley for A ($61.67), but it ensures the $120 deal which is the highest possible.
